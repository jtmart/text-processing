Contd.2/-  - 2 - STATEMENT AS REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.28 FOR 22. 07.2015 REGARDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY TDB (a) By the Technology Development Board Act of 1995, the Government of India has constituted a Technology Development Board (TDB) to provide equity capital or any other financial assistance to industrial concerns and other agencies attempting commercial application of indigenous technology or adapting imported technology for wider domestic application. For the above stated purpose TDB can provide financial assistance in the form of equity, loan or grant. So far grant is concerned, it has been provided only to the projects of public sector units, projects in north east and under seed support scheme to the National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board (NSTEDB), Department of Science and Technology (DST) supported incubators for providing seed level financing to start ups. The equity has been provided in some projects where it was felt that they are of national importance and by way of contribution in Venture Capital Funds who primarily invest in technology oriented projects. The main chunk of TDBs financial assistance is in the form of soft loan @ 5% simple interest per annum limited to 50% of the project cost for a project undertaking commercialization of indigenous technologies. Since inception till June, 2015, TDB has so far provided financial assistance of Rs. 1249.85 crores to the industrial concerns in 324 projects with the details given as under:   Soft Loans to 264 Companies with a total disbursement of Rs. 876.84 Cr.approx. Equity Investments in 5 Companies with a total disbursement of Rs. 13.33 Cr.approx. Equity Contribution in 13 VCFs with a total disbursement of Rs. 222.85 Cr.approx. Grants to 42 projects with a total disbursement of Rs. 136.83 Cr. Approx.(b) As per Technology Development Board (TDBs) mandate, TDB provides financial assistance to the industrial concerns/ companies which are undertaking commercialization of indigenous technologies or adapting imported technologies for wider domestic application. Although there is no cap on TDB funding to the projects, however, as most of the projects are for commercialization of indigenous technology, it has been seen that the project cost in Contd.3/-  - 3 - projects financed by TDB so far ranges from Rs. 1.00 crore to Rs. 30.00 crores and as per TDBs policy, the financial assistance is limited to 50% of the project cost. TDB''s support covers various sectors such as Healthcare, Engineering, Agriculture, Energy & Waste Utilization, Telecommunication and Information Technology etc. The year wise details of technology projects received and financed during the last three (3) years are as under: Year Technology Proposals received Projects financed Year Amount disbursed (Rs.in crores) 2012-13 65 25 116.21 2013-14 44 17 99.11 2014-15 28 NIL 10.19 2015-16 (Current year) 5 NIL 16.21  Sector-wise Details of TDB funded projects in 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15 & 2015-16 Year Sector No.of Projects funded Type of funding (1) (2) (3) (4) 2012-13 Health & Medical 6 Loan Engineering 4 Loan Electronics 2 Loan Chemical 3 Loan Agriculture 1 Loan Information Technology 6 Loan Others VCFs 2 Equity Millennium Alliance (MA) 1 Grant Total 25  2013-14 Health & Medical 6 Loan Engineering 5 Loan Electronics 1 Loan Chemical 1 Loan Agriculture 1 Loan Information Technology 1 Loan Telecom 1 Loan Others GITA 1 Equity Total 17 2014-15 NIL 2015-16 NIL  Contd.4/-  - 4 - (d) All the proposals which were received were put to TDBs evaluation process and the ones which were found fit were provided TDBs financial assistance which is limited to 50% of the project cost.

"i50612","t19900806456059","I am very happy to be in your midst this morning to inaugurate
the 41st meeting of the Small -Scale Industries Board. This is a
valuable forum which brings together all those concerned with
small-scale industry-Central Ministers, Industry Ministers of all
States/UTs and most important of all, the representatives of the
small-scale industries associations and experts from the field. I am
delighted to have the opportunity to address this distinguished
gathering and talk about the subject which is dear to my heart.
I would like to begin by asserting that the National Front
Government is firmly committed to the development of the small-
scale industrial sector. Our commitment is not based solely on
theoretical expectations of what the small sector can do. It is
founded on the bedrock of the performance of this sector during
80s, and its evident capacity to tackle some of the key problems of
economic development of the 90s. My colleague, Shri Ajit Singh
has already recounted the progress made by this sector in the recent
past. I am very pleased to hear that the small sector has performed
exceedingly well, not only in terms of a higher growth in gross
value of output and employment, but also in the highly competitive
field of exports which is crucial for our national economy. This
performance is all the more impressive when we consider the
innumerable problems faced by this sector; problems which I can
assure you will try very hard to resolve.
Our commitment to the small-scale sector is not new. In the
National Front's manifesto for the last Lok Sabha elections, we
had clearly recognised the role that this sector could play in the
overall development of the country. We said, and I quote:
“The National Front Government will promote industrial
development in such a way as to maximise employment. The
emphasis will be on producing wage goods and services
required for consumption by the mass of our people. Agro
processing industries of particular benefit to women and rural
households will receive full support by way of credit, extension
service, supply of inputs, marketing organisation etc.
Manufacture of items of mass consumption, which can be
produced by the cottage and small-scale industries, will be
reserved for these centres”.
It is now our duty to redeem this pledge. We have indicated our
broad approach to the small-scale sector in the Approach
document, which has been unanimously approved by the NDC.
The Approach clearly states: “Measures must. be taken to ensure
this spread of industry, particularly of small-scale industries, to
rural and backward areas. A balanced approach would recognise
the existence and rationale for three sub-sets calling for
differentiated strategies. The first and the foremost are the
village/household enterprises including Khadi and village
industries, handlooms, handicrafts, sericulture and coir, which
have tremendous potential in terms of utilisation of local resources
and skills, and creation of gainful employment with low investment
and minimal dislocation. The second category pertains to the ‘tiny’
sector that accounts for majority of the units in the small-scale
sector, and which has shown its capability to promote growth and
employment generation. The modern small-scale sector is third
category. It has the proven potential for dynamic growth,
technological upgradation and ability to compete internationally”.
The National Front Government is committed to supporting the
growth of all three sub-sets of the small-scale sector.
As the first step towards achieving these objectives, the National
Front Government created a separate Department for Small Scale
Industries and Agro and Rural Industries in the Ministry of
Industry. This has been a long-standing demand of the small-scale
sector. It is our hope that the new department will serve as a focus
for developing an imaginative and positive approach to the
development of the small-scale sector.
The Finance Minister in his Budget speech has also announced
the reintroduction of a Central Investment Subsidy Scheme
exclusively for the small-scale sector in the rural and backward
areas. The Small Industries Development Bank of India has also
been put into operation in April, 1990. Both these steps will
strengthen the fiscal and financial support available to small
entrepreneurs.
The policy measures announced in May, 1990 are designed to re
orient industrial growth to serve the objective of employment
generation, dispersal of industry in the rural areas, and to enhance
the contribution of small-scale industries to exports. We will keep
careful watch on the operation of the policy measures and their
implementation on the ground to ensure that the small-scale sector
gets the full benefit intended in support of its development.
I would like to remove one misconception which people some
times have about the large and small-scale sectors. It is often
believed that there is dichotomy between the two and they work at
cross purposes. This is far from true. In fact, they are both
supplementary and complementary to each other. Our industrial
policy, right from the beginning has emphasised economic
federalism and decentralisation of the economy. The large sector
should concentrate on capital-intensive, technologically sophisticated,
and export-oriented fields, and areas where economies of scale are
important. The small-scale sector should concentrate on items of
mass consumption and operate in areas of simpler technology
catering to the needs of the local population.
Small units also have an indispensable role to play in the
development of our modern industries, particularly in engineering
and electronics, where they can complement large-scale units with
a symbiotic relationship between the two. In many areas of
industry, except those involving process of production, it may not
be economical for large-scale units to produce everything in-
house. That is the reason why small-scale has not disappeared in
the highly industrialised countries, but continues to grow and
prosper. As far as possible, therefore, our large units should farm
out the manufacture of components, spares and sub-assemblies to
the small-scale sector, and produce the final product at the most
economical price, without compromising on quality. The
importance of ancillarisation must be realised and this should be
practised both by public and private sector undertakings. In the
industrial scenario envisaged in the Eighth Plan, this concept has
increasing relevance, both in terms of employment generation and
increasing competitiveness.
We are now engaged in the task of formulating detailed targets
and proposals for the Eighth Five Year Plan. I am sure that the
small-scale sector would like to scale greater heights by assigning to
itself higher targets, particularly in regard to employment and
exports. While formulating these proposals, I hope you will take
special care to reduce the urban bias of the modern small-scale
sector and to ensure that more employment is created in the rural
and backward areas.
In his opening remarks, the Industry Minister has referred to
certain problems being faced by the small-scale sector which tend
to impede its growth. These relate primarily to the adequate and
timely availability of credit and raw materials, difficulties in
marketing, discrimination in the field of raw materials allocation,
and the suffocating grip of the ‘Inspector Raj’. I do not propose to
go into the details of these problems at this stage. However, I would
urge our colleagues who are present here to look into these
problems sympathetically and ensure that there is no discrimination
against this preferred sector. We should also put our heads
together and see if the ‘Inspector Raj’ can be dismantled altogether,
at least for the tiny sector to begin with, if not the entire small-scale
sector. This is an area where corrective action has to be taken not
only by the Central Government, but also State Governments. I
hope the meeting will come up with workable proposals to achieve
this objective.
Before I conclude, I have some words of advice for the small-
scale units. These relate to quality control and energy
conservation. One often hears complaints of the products
manufactured by the small-scale sector; these are either unsafe or
unsatisfactory in terms of performance. While all the complaints
may not be well-founded, there is certainly no room for
complacency on the subject of quality control. Experience in the
rest of the world shows that small-scale production is not
necessarily associated with compromise on quality. This is the
ideal, we must also adopt in our small-scale sector. I have no doubt,
it can be done through greater management, commitment and
appropriate upgradation of technology wherever needed.
Turning to energy conservation, I regret to say that the record of
our small industrial units is not at all satisfactory. How many of
you assembled here would be willing to assert with conviction that
the products you manufacture are energy efficient? As you are all
aware, the generation of additional energy is expensive and capital-
intensive. We must, therefore, spare no effort to conserve energy. I
am told that we can save more than a thousand crores of rupees a
year if we simply change the design of our pumping systems; just
one item in the whole array of industrial products. Here same thing
is true of a number of domestic electrical appliances. Energy is far
too expensive to waste through energy inefficient products. We
must step up our RandD efforts in this direction. We must upgrade
our designs and processes to develop energy efficient products.
This is a challenge which the small-scale sector must address as
much as the large-scale. I have no doubt that it can be done.","pms","vpsingh","1990","199008","19900806","pmo","firstterm","jana3","nationalpol","speech","other","other","other","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hindiother","smallsectorfordynamicgrowth","jn5","vps1990","1969","1969","notrans","collective","others","others","others","others","others","vpsingh","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","vps_spe","na","yes","others","m","jpd","vps_nt","vps_jana3","jpd_spe","jpd_nt","jpd_jana3","m_spe","m_nt","m_jana3","pms1990","pms_spe","pms_nt","pms_jana3","vps","vps","vps","vps","vps","vps","vps","vps","vps","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","vps","pms","others","vps","pms","others","vps","pms","others","vps","pms","others","vps_spe","pms_spe","o_spe","vps_nt","pms_nt","o_nt","vps_jana3","pms_jana3","o_jana3","mint","clean","plib","hindiother","pms","vps","nt","spe","f","jpd_vps","jpd_spe","jpd_jana3","jpd_nt","plib_vps","plib_spe","plib_jana3","plib_nt","plib_jpd","plib1990","plib_jpd_spe","vps_spe_1990","vps_nt_1990","jpd_spe_1990","jpd_nt_1990","other","o199008","vps_spe_199008","vps_spe","vps_spe","vps_spe","vps_nt","pms_spe","pms_nt","vps_spe","vps_spe","vps_spe","vps_spe","vps_s","vps_s","vps_s","vps_s","Ps","Ps","Ps","Ps",NA,NA,NA,1594

Mr. Shelat was some time ago serving imprisonment as a passive
resister at Diepkloof, and underwent prolonged solitary confinement
for refusing to carry slop-pails. The discharged passive resisters have
brought the message to my Association that the remaining British
Indian prisoners at Diepkloof are quite agreeable that Mr. Shelat, who
is a Brahmin and has very great conscientious scruples about
removing slop-pails, should be excused from having to perform that
work; and that the other British Indian prisoners will be prepared to
replace him whenever his turn comes to remove the pails.3 My
Association does not know whether Mr. Shelat has yet been ordered to
do this work, but I consider it my duty to bring the above matter to
your notice, so that such instructions as you may consider fit may be
issued to the officials at Diepkloof.

"i35073","t19410917382712","I have sent a message for women and children to this effect:2
Enough khadi can be produced if children up to the age of twelve and
women gave a few hours of their spare time to spinning and other
processes of khadi production. I had asked Krishnadas Gandhi to work
out some figures to prove the above contention. I give below an abstract
of the findings.
India’s population was estimated at about 35 crores in the
1931 census. Children in the  age-group  of  eight  to  twelve
numbered about 4_ crores and women and girls above the age
of 12 numbered about 11 crores. If the children devoted four
hours to cleaning, carding and spinning  and  if  the  women
devoted four hours to cleaning, carding, spinning and weaving
daily, enough khadi can  be produced. It can  be  shown  by
calculation that the children can produce every day yarn of ten
to twelve counts that can be woven into 90 lac square yards of
khadi, whereas the women can produce every day two crore
square yards of twenty counts in addition to weaving the ninety
lac square yards of khadi out of the yarn spun by the children.
has  been  calculated  that the entire process from  the
cleaning of  cotton to weaving a
cloth involves 18  hours  of  labour  on  the part of one person.
Out  of  this half  an hour will go to the cleaning of cotton, two
unwinding the yarn, one hour for making and fixing the warp
and sizing and one and a half hours for actual weaving. This is
average skill of an average person. An efficient worker may
complete this process in just 15 hours. On a rough estimate the
women and children can, with such skill as they have, produce
about 30 square yards of khadi for every person in this country
by working four hours a day for 300 days in a year.
My object in publishing this abstract is to encourage an institution
to undertake an experiment to corroborate it. Any family can easily
produce all the cloth that it requires by introducing a charkha and a
loom in their home. Suppose there are 35 individuals in an institution
including four children in the age-group of 8 to 12 and 11 women
13. All men, of course, will be  busy  with other
activities. Ten out of the eleven women and all the four children can
devote three to four hours every day to cleaning, carding, spinning and
weaving according to their convenience. One of the ten women will help
the four children and will also weave the yarn produced by the children.
The remaining nine women will undertake all the work from cleaning to
weaving. According to the calculations given above, the four children
together with one woman will produce at least three fourths of a square
yard of 10 to 12 counts khadi every day and the 9 women will easily
produce two square yards of 20 counts khadi every day. If we calculate
for 300 days in a year, all of them will together produce 225 square
yards of coarse khadi and 600 square yards of fine khadi. Thus a total
of 825 square yards of cloth will be available for the 35 persons or, in
other words, everyone will get
efficiency grows every individual will be able to get 27_ square yards of
cloth.
It should be remembered that so much cloth can be produced
even in less time by using the now improved charkhas and carding-
bows. If every home has a charkha and a loom we can produce the cloth
we need with very little effort. It will create a great contentment in the
home. We can only imagine what an impact this can have on our lives
and how it can inspire all the people. But for oneself one can instantly
discover this bliss.

"i657546","t20161207583756","   (a) No, Madam.(b) The Government is making conscious effort to increase the access as well improve the quality in science, education and research. The Gross Enrolment Ratio in the country, in higher education is constantly increasing and the number of students who are opting for science is also increasing. India''s performance in scientific research is promising and impressive in recent years which is evident from the fact that Indias position globally in scientific publications, as per Scopus database, has improved from 12th position in 2005 to 6th position in 2013 with a growth rate of 13.9% as against the world average of 4.1% during 2009-2013. In the field of nanoscience and technology, India was at 3rd position in 2013. In 2006, Indias output of papers in Chemistry was fourth and by 2013 it was third behind United States of America and China. A report of Springer Nature has indicated that India is ascending towards world-class science and our country is at 13th position globally on an index of world-class scientific journals.(c) & (d): India invests 0.88% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) towards Research and Development (R & D). However, the Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) in the country has been consistently increasing over the years. The GERD is estimated to be Rs.62,053.47 crores in 2010-11 and Rs.72,620.44 crores in 2011-12. The allocation for Ministry of Science and Technology has increased from Rs.5145 crore in 2013-14 to Rs.8100 crore in 2016-17. Unlike in the best performing countries, the R&D investment by private sector is low (close to one-third of the GERD) in our country which also contribute to low % of GERD.(e) Government has taken several steps to attract investment for improving the status of science, education and research in the country. This includes launching of new programmes / schemes and interfacing with other Ministries / Departments and Industries to leverage their resources and expertise in undertaking research of national relevance and thereby enhancing the share of scientific research in GDP. The initiatives such as IMPRINT (IMPacting Research INnovation and Technology), Uchhatar Avishkar Yojana (UAY), Industry Relevant R&D are directed towards attracting more funds in research and development in partnership with national institutions and private industries.","minister","ls16","2016","201612","20161207","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2016","259251","319859","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shriyschowdary","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2016","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2016","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2016","l16_nt_2016","bjp_qna_2016","bjp_nt_2016","other","n201612","l16_qna_201612","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","ScienceandTechnology","awhetheroveralldeteriorationinscienceeducationandresearchhasbeennotedwhichisamatterofgreatconcernbifsothedetailsthereofandthereasonsthereforcwhethertheUnionGovernmentisallottinglessthanonepercentofGDPtosciencedifsothereasonsthereforandethestepstakenbeingtakentoprovidemorefundsforthispurpose","newdelhi",388

havoc, but it has also brought to the fore the best qualities of the
people afflicted. An organization grew up all of a sudden which
battled with the calamity with great decision and equally great success.

Miss Schlesin has been of late writing to me regularly, and of
course she is as mad and as good as ever. Albert3 never writes
nowadays. I did however get accounts of him and know that he and
his are doing very well indeed. Manilal and his wife have been writing
to me regularly.

I am keeping fairly well. Perhaps I shall never regain the
original health, but I am thankful for whatever strength God has yet
left me.

I hope you are getting Young India as also Indian Opinion
regularly. If not, please let me know. Prabhudas is now much better.
He is at a hill station with his father. The others whom you know are
doing well. If you are photographed do send me one. I am sure all at
the Ashram who know you and love you well, love to see you in the
spirit if they cannot see you in the flesh. I have had a strenuous tour
in the south of India including Ceylon as you must have seen. I hope
now to reach the Ashram on or before new-year’s day.

"i2728","t19090227140623","We congratulate the [Natal Indian] Congress on having held a
meeting in support of the Transvaal campaign. In our view, the
meeting was rather thinly attended, not much enthusiasm having been
in evidence, and it had not been called as expeditiously as it should
have been, so that we rest content with the mere fact of the meeting
having been held, on the principle that something is better than
nothing.1 All the same, the Natal leaders will be blamed for their lapse
to the extent that they were found wanting.

We believe that they ought not to rest content merely with a
meeting. The Government will arrest as many persons as it wants to,
and then watch the fun. But Indians outside the Transvaal cannot
afford to sit back.They must send frequent cable reports to India,
revive the spirit of those in the Transvaal who have fallen and by such
means focus public attention on the struggle all over the world. If that
is done, the gods of heaven will descend to watch the battle that will
ensue. If not, Indians will be ridiculed and lose their foothold in South
Africa in the near future.

We spoke of a Natal meeting. Really speaking, it was only a
Durban meeting. What has happened to Maritzburg and the other
towns in Natal? Why should they not hold meetings? The main Line
dispute has not yet been resolved. People are preoccupied with
questions of prestige and dignity while their brethren are in gaol. This
is not dignified behaviour. The Main Line dispute ought to be
resolved. Even if it is not, work can be carried on in the other main
towns of Natal.

What is Natal’s duty is also the duty of the Cape, Delagoa Bay
and other places. Cablegrams should be dispatched to England from
all these places. Money too will be needed for such an agitation; for
this regular provision should be made. It every Indian does his duty
and performs the community’s tasks in the same spirit that he does his

"i651884","t20160803584835","a) Yes Sir. As per a study conducted by Assocham The Gems & Jewellery Industry- Contributing to Make in India, the high growth rate of the gems and jewellery industry indicates the potentially high demand for skilled manpower in the future. However, the inherent skills in gold-smith families and on-the job training is not sufficient, especially when the need is to modernize, in order to beat global competition.(b) to (e) Over 95,000 candidates have been trained & certified in the gems and jewellery sector since 2014, under schemes like National Skill Certification and Monetary Reward Scheme (STAR) & Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). The Sector Skill Council for Gems & Jewellery has trained more than 500 trainers, who have been certified under the Training of Trainers Programme. Two Centres of Excellence have been set up by the Sector Skill Council to provide support for the development of courseware, curriculum, trainers guide, assessors guide etc. These Centres of Excellence also support R&D within the manufacturing processes and keep abreast with the technological advances happening in India and around the world. Efforts are continuously being made to improve the productivity of workers, by improving their working conditions. Increased use of advanced technology and its ease of use, is facilitating artisans to learn the work faster and even school dropouts are able to make a career within the industry.","minister","ls16","2016","201608","20160803","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2016","222899","314197","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2016","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2016","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2016","l16_nt_2016","bjp_qna_2016","bjp_nt_2016","other","n201608","l16_qna_201608","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","SkillDevelopmentandEntrepreneurship","awhethertheGovernmentisawarethatthereisshortageofskilledgemsandjewelleryworkersinthecountryasperthestudyconductedbyASSOCHAMbifsowhethertheGovernmenthastakenanystepstoincreasethenumberofskilledgemsandjewelleryworkerscifsothedetailsthereofdwhethertheGovernmenthasdecidedtoassociatetheworkersofthesaidsectorswithskilldevelopmentschemeandifsothedetailsthereofandewhethertheGovernmenthaspreparedanyschemetoprovidemodernmachinessoftwaremoderntechniqueandsecuritykittotheworkersworkinginthesaidsectorandifsothedetailsthereof","newdelhi",228

ANNEXURE  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.187 TO BE ANSWERED ON 11. 12.2008 TABLED BY PROF. M. RAMADASS AND SHRI MADAN LAL SHARMA, REGARDING DISABLED CHILDREN  (a) & (b) According to NSSO Survey, 2002,there were an estimated 45 lakh children with disabilities in the age group of 5 to 18 years of whom about 47% were enrolled in schools.(c) & (d) Provisions of the Act,relating to education of children, are meant to be implemented by-appropriate Governments,Local Authorities and Educational Institutions. Some of the important steps being taken by the Central Government in this regard are as follows:-  (i) Assistance is being provided to States under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD),which aims to provide elementary education to all children,including children with disabilities,in the age group of 6-14 years. SSA`s component of `Inclusive Education` aims to educate disabled children in general schools, as far as possible,through various interventions like identification of children with disabilities and their enrolment in schools,appointment of special teachers and barrier-free facilities in schools, allowances for books and stationery, uniform, transport,boarding and lodging,readers, escorts, teacher training, appropriate teaching learning material, provision of Braille books and .assistive devices,alternative schooling,distance education and learning,home-based education, itinerant teachers,remedial teaching,etc. As per information available, upto 30th September,2008, 27.23 lakh children with disabilities were identified under SSA, of whom 22.53 lakh children were enrolled in general schools. 0.88 lakh children with disabilities have been covered under Education Guarantee Scheme and Alternative and Innovative Education and 1.12 lakh children with disabilities are being provided home-based education. Up to 30th September,2008,about 17.59 lakh teachers of general elementary schools were trained for inclusive education for 3-6 days and 0.79 lakh teachers trained for 90 days. Ramps and handrails have been provided in 6.48 lakh elementary schools up to 30th September, 2008 so as to make them barrier-free. 11.26 lakh students with disabilities of elementary schools have been provided assistive devices under SSA up to 30th September,2008.(ii) Under another Centrally Sponsored Scheme of MHRD called `Integrated Education for Disabled Children (IEDC)`, in 2007-08, assistance has been given to 18 States and 3 UTs for 64307 schools where 3.57 lakh children with disabilities studied in 2007-08. The scheme has been revised in 2008, and the revised scheme known as `Inclusive Education of the Disabled at Secondary Stage (IEDSS)` will now cover education of all children with special needs in Classes IX to XII.(iii) Under the `Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS)` of the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment,assistance is being provided for education and vocational training of approximately 80,000 children with disabilities in about 700 institutions of special education and vocational training being run by Non Governmental Organizations.(iv) 12450 teachers specially equipped to teach children with disabilities are being trained in 389 institutions recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India every year. In addition, approximately 4500 special teachers are being trained through distance mode in 113 study centres. Thus, approximately 16950 special teachers for teaching children with disabilities are being trained every year.(v) Central Board of Secondary Education has provided special facilities to meet the needs of students with disabilities in examination. For visually impaired children,it has provided facility of scribe, extra time of 60 minutes in each paper,alternative questions in lieu of questions having visual inputs,and use of computers/typewriters for writing answers. For hearing impaired, there is an option to take only one language.","minister","ls14","2008","200812","20081211","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2008","116468","194341","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","smtmeirakumar","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2008","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2008","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2008","l14_nt_2008","inc_qna_2008","inc_nt_2008","other","n200812","l14_qna_200812","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","SocialJusticeandEmpowerment","athetotalnumberofdisabledchildreninthecountrybthetotalnumberofdisabledchildrenwhohavereceivededucationcwhetherthepersonswithDisabilitiesEqualOpportunitiesProtectionofRightsandFullParticipationAct1995isnotbeingimplementedproperlytoachieveitsgoalanddifsothestepstakenbeingtakenbytheUnionGovernmenttoensureeffectiveimplementationoftheActtobenefitthedisabledchildren","newdelhi",640
"i52805","t20050101114250","Fiscal outcome 2004-05

With the notification of the FRBM rules,
quarterly reviews of Union finances are
required to be placed before Parliament, and
the monitoring of fiscal outcome has
assumed significance. The Mid-year review
presented to Parliament in December 2004,
contained, inter alia, fiscal performance in
the first half of the current financial year. The
fiscal performance in the first half of the
current year did not fully measure up to the
benchmarks laid down in the FRBM rules.
Non-debt receipts at 41.8 per cent and fiscal
deficit at 38.7 per cent of BE are better than
the FRBM benchmarks of 40 per cent and
per cent, respectively reflecting an excess
of receipts under prepayment of high cost
loans by States, relative to BE. Revenue
deficit at 78.7 per cent of BE is considerably
in excess of FRBM benchmark of 45 per
cent. The main reason for the slippage in
achieving the FRBM benchmark of revenue
deficit is that growth in overall tax revenue in
the first half of the year at 20 per cent fell
short of the growth of 25 per cent assumed
in the Budget. The Mid-Year Review indicated
that while the cumulative impact of post-
budget duty concessions and additional
expenditure commitments could lead to some
slippage in meeting the ambitious Budget
targets of reducing revenue deficit, the
minimum targets prescribed under the FRBM
rules would be met.

The Office of the Controller General
of Accounts (CGA) has released the Central
Government accounts for the first nine
months (April- December 2004) of the current
financial year. Gross tax revenue grew by
per cent in the first nine months of the
current financial year, as compared with 12.3
per cent growth recorded in the
corresponding period last year and 25 per
cent growth envisaged in the BE for 2004-
As a per cent of BE, gross tax revenue
realised was lower at 61.1 per cent compared
to 65.3 per cent in the corresponding period
last year. The Budget for 2004-05 targeted a
growth over 2003-04 (RE) of 34.9 per cent
and 18.4 per cent in direct and indirect taxes,
respectively. While direct taxes grew by 25.2
per cent in the first nine months of the current
financial year, indirect taxes grew by 13.7
per cent. As a proportion of BE, revenue
realised from personal income tax and
customs in the current financial year was
more or less on par with the realisation in
the corresponding period last year. Revenue
realised from corporate income tax, excise
and service tax in the first nine months of
the current financial year, as per cent of BE,
was lower as compared with the realisations
in the corresponding period last year. Non-
tax revenue in the first nine months of the
current year declined by 8.7 per cent and as
a proportion of BE at 62.6 per cent was lower
than the realisation in the corresponding
period last year (74.2 per cent), mainly
reflecting lower interest receipts and dividends
and profits.

Revenue expenditure in the first nine
months of the current financial year grew by
per cent compared to 11.5 per cent
growth in the same period last year. This
was facilitated by a 14 per cent decline in
major subsidies, a lower growth in interest
payments, and in non-Plan expenditure on
capital account. The deceleration in the
growth in interest payments is mainly on
account of softening of interest rates. The
lower growth in non-Plan expenditure on
capital account was due to lower redemption
of securities issued to NSSF using the
proceeds of prepayment of high cost debt by
States under the debt swap scheme. Lower
growth in Plan expenditure, both revenue and
capital, in the first nine months of the current
financial year was on account of the delay in
the allocation of additional outlay of Rs.10,000
crore due to the presentation of regular
Budget for 2004-05 on July 8, 2004.

Revenue deficit amounted to
Rs.62,969 crore in the first nine months of
the current financial year, a decline of 13.7
per cent in actual terms over corresponding
period last year. However, as a proportion of
BE, it was higher in the current financial year
at 82.7 per cent as against 65.0 per cent
recorded in the same period last year, Fiscal
deficit amounted to Rs.90,239 crore, a
decline of 2.4 per cent over corresponding
period last year. As a proportion of BE, fiscal
deficit was higher at 65.7 per cent of BE in
the first nine months of the current financial
year compared to 60.2 per cent last year

"i6356","t19200425111419","Some readers take such a keen interest in all my actions that I
am not always able to satisfy their curiosity. The reason is not my
negligence, but the fact that I do not get enough time to answer all
questions and that it is not possible for me to spare sufficient space in
Navajivan for answering them through it. Some matters, however,
being of public interest, I consider it essential to clarify the position.
One such issue is the proposal that I should go to England.

Some readers have asked me why I, being generally opposed to
leaders going to England, have myself now got ready to go. What they
say about my view is quite correct and so their question is perfectly
justified. But, then, I have never believed that no one should go to
England under any circumstances. I can imagine a situation in which
to refuse to go to England would be criminal. Not that I think of the
Khila-fat issue in this light. It is not quite essential that I should go.1
How-ever, my going may possibly do some good and so I have left
the final decision to Muslim friends. When they expressed a desire
that I should be ready to go in case they wanted me to do so. I agreed,
and put forward two conditions : one, that people here should really
be keen [that a deputation should go] and, two, that we should have
the permission and approval of the Viceroy. His permission has been
received. But he hesitates to express an opinion on the desirability of
our going. So again I went to the Khilafat Committee and left to them
the responsibility of deciding what I should do in this situation. There
is a difference of opinion among the members. The general view was
that, for the present, we should give up the idea of going; accordingly,
the proposal of going to England has been dropped.

We were to go not only for the purpose of securing a settlement
but also, should the settlement not meet our demands, to warn them of
the reactions in India. Non-co-operation is no ordinary weapon.
Properly employed, it can secure us full justice. I would, therefore,
think it essential to give the fullest warning to the Government before
employing such a mighty weapon and would welcome the idea of
going to England for that purpose, circumstances permitting. But the
Viceroy did not approve and we, ourselves, are not quite ready; I
decided, therefore, that it would be better if I did not go. Even so, if
the Muslim friends want me to go or if I see that the Government
would like my going, I would certainly agree to go.

No.4 regarding `Irregularities in IPO` by Shri Rajiv Ranjan Singh ``Lalan`` and Shri C. K Chandrappan on 17. 02.2006.(a) and (b): SEBI has noticed certain irregularities in the issue of Initial Public Offering (IPO) shares in the recent past while examining the dealings in shares relating to the IPOs of the Yes Bank Ltd.and IDFC. The enquiries and investigations made so far by RBI and SEBI seem to indicate that a few entities opened thousands of demat accounts with Depository Participants (DPs) and bank accounts with Banks in the names of fictitious / benami individuals. They applied for shares in IPOs from these benami / fictitious accounts in sizes permissible for retail individual investors (RIIs) and obtained allotment. As a result, the genuine RIIs failed to get allotment or got allotment of fewer shares than they would have otherwise got.(c) and (d): The enquiries and investigation made so far by RBI and SEBI seem to indicate that the bank accounts with Banks and demat accounts with depositorie,s participants (DPs) were opened without adherence to prescribed procedures. Some Banks extended IPO finance and facilitated movement of funds in violation of the guidelines.(e) and (f): The penal actions taken by SEBI include: debarring concerned entities from dealing in securities market / dealing in IPO; directing the concerned DPs participants not to open fresh demat accounts till further directions; directing the depositories to enhance their surveillance system, and ordering inspection of the concerned Registrar to Issue and Merchant Bankers. In order to prevent recurrence of the irregularities, the measures taken by SEBI include: directing the depositories to advise their respective DPs to verify the genuineness of the demat account-holders where 20 or more demat account-holders have a common address; advising them to identify all the other IPOs during 2004 and 2005 wherein the same modus operandi had been adopted by the identified entities; directing them to form a co-ordination committee to co-ordinate with the surveillance department of SEBI for monitoring abnormal transactions in demat accounts; and advising them that in case of IPOs they should activate the Indian Securities Numbering System (ISIN) only on the date of commencement of trading on the stock exchanges. The penal actions taken by RBI include imposition of penalties ranging from Rs.5 lakh to Rs.20 lakh against 7 Banks taking into account the extent and enormity of the violation of the RBI guidelines. Other measures include: advising all scheduled commercial banks, excluding RRBs, to conduct a review of IPO financing and related matters, like opening of multiple accounts, adherence to KYC/AML guidelines and RBI instructions on IPO financing, advances against shares, etc.; prohibiting the Banks from crediting `account payee` cheques to account of any person other than the payee named therein; and taking up an examination of the internal control systems and processes in the banks to assess the areas of weakness with regard to KYC, IPO finance, advances against shares and internal controls etc.","minister","ls14","2006","200602","20060217","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2006","138837","158288","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shpchidambaram","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2006","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2006","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2006","l14_nt_2006","inc_qna_2006","inc_nt_2006","other","n200602","l14_qna_200602","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","Finance","awhethertheGovernmenthasnoticedanyscamirregularitiesintheissueofInitialPublicOfferIPOofsharesinrecentpastbifsothedetailsthereofcwhethertheGovernmenthasconductedanyinquiryinthisregarddifsothedetailsthereofetheactiontakenbeingtakenbytheGovernmentagainsttheguiltybanksfinancialinstitutionsindividualsandfthepreventivestepstakenproposedtobetakentoavoidsuchscamsirregularitiesinfuture","newdelhi",523

I can’t understand how you received on the same day the letters
handed over by me on different days. I will inquire of the authorities.
Henceforth, whenever you receive a letter from me mention in your
next letter the date on which it was posted, the date on the letter itself
and the date on which you received it. If you let me know every time
these dates as you have done this time, I can ask the authorities here to
be more alert.
posted on the 19th were received yesterday.
I am convinced that we shall gain nothing from Krishnamaiy-
adevi’s connection with the Ashram. If it seems proper to you, you
may fix a monthly allowance to be paid to her for some time. During
that  period,  Mahavir  should  secure  a  job.  The  mother  and  the
daughters also should work. I would have no objection to their being
paid  Rs.
50  a  month  for  four  months  plus  railway  fare  from
Ahmedabad to the place where they decide to go and live. These are
my personal views. If, however, all of you there have discussed the
matter and come to some other decision, you should abide by it and
implement it. I still advise you to write to the persons who have lent
them money. We shall thereby know, we ought to know, what the facts
are.
You may derive what consolation you can from the fact that
. . .1 has harassed me more than he has done you. And he has crossed
all bounds in his behaviour to me this time. All the same, we should
go on doing our duty by him. I may even have made a mistake in
permitting him to join the Ashram. I also doubt whether he really
suffers from tuberculosis. However, I never  regret  such  mistakes.
Anybody who tries to follow ahimsa is bound to commit them. How
can we judge a man’s worth?  Does he live in the Ashram now?
I hope Indira has recovered. How does Ramnik behave?
If Bhikhabhai lives in the Ashram, does he take his meals at
home or in the Ashram kitchen?
As for the land cess to be paid by the Ashram, you may do what
you think right. I am writing to Mama about khadi.2 I have more of it
here than I need.
There is no harm in Amtussalaam going to Delhi. She has faith
in Dr. Sharma and the latter is confident. Just now the weather in
Delhi will also be lovely. She seems to be very eager to come and see
me. Do what you think right about that.
I got Prema’s letter. I, therefore, don’t write about the matter
here. You may know my views from the letter which I will write to her.
In all there are 24 letters, stitched together.

AQUACULTURE IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR FOR SEAFOOD EXPORTS FROM THE COUNTRY. TO INCREASE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AQUACULTURE, THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE HAS TAKEN INITIATIVES THROUGH NATIONAL FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT BOARD FOR EXPANSION OF AQUACULTURE INTO NEW AREAS INCREASING THE PRODUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY IN ALREADY DEVELOPED AREAS AND ALSO THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION OF AQUACULTURE. MAXIMUM EFFORTS ARE BEING DONE TO PROMOTE AQUACULTURE SECTOR IN ORDER TO SUPPLY RAW MATERIALS TO SEAFOOD INDUSTRY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF AQUACULTURE IN THE COASTAL STATES HAS GENERATED A LOT OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE RURAL AREAS PARTICULARLY AMONG THE RURAL POOR AND CONTRIBUTED TO DEVELOPMENT OF THE RURAL ECONOMY AS WELL. AS ON 2005-06, ABOUT 1,91,000 HECTARE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR SHRIMP FARMING, AND ABOUT 51,500 HECTARE FOR SCAMPI FARMING, 1,43,170 MT OF SHRIMP AND 42,820 MT OF SCAMPI WERE PRODUCED RESPECTIVELY FOR EXPORT. A MISSION MODE PROGRAMME HAS BEEN INITIATED FOR EXPANSION OF SHRIMP AND SCAMPI FARMING IN UNDER-DEVELOPED AND UNUTILIZED AREAS OF GUJARAT, MAHARASHTRA AND ORISSA. GOVERNMENT IS ENCOURAGING FARMERS TO FORM AQUA CLUBS FOR PROMOTING BETTER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN CLUSTERS OF SHRIMP FARMING AREAS AIMING TOWARDS INCREASING PRODUCTION, PRODUCTIVITY AND RETURNS. THIS CONCEPT HAS BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING THE RISKS OF DISEASES AND INCREASING THE PRODUCTION AND AT THE SAME TIME REDUCING THE COST OF PRODUCTION. THE PILOT SCALE WORK DONE IN ANDHRA PRADESH IS NOW BEING EXPANDED TO OTHER STATES LIKE GUJARAT, KARNATAKA, TAMIL NADU AND ORISSA. FURTHER, THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE HAS ALSO INTRODUCED VARIOUS SCHEMES THROUGH MARINE PRODUCTS EXPORT DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY FOR PROMOTING CAPTURE FISHERIES, CULTURE FISHERIES, DEVELOPMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURAL FACILITIES AND MARKET PROMOTION FOR IMPROVING/ EQUIPPING THE INDUSTRY FOR THE EXPORT OF MARINE PRODUCTS.(D): THE REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH EXPORTS BY THE SEAFOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES IN WEST BENGAL AND ORISSA DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS ARE FURNISHED BELOW: PERIOD  WEST BENGAL ORISSA    (RS.

I got your letter only yesterday. I therefore sent a  wire to
Rajendra Babu asking him to attend the Conference and seek out
Maulvi Abdul Haq Saheb. It is tragic that Nagpur should have so
upset him. I have not yet traced the reason for his displeasure. I am
glad you have sent Mujeeb1 to Patna. You will please tell me what
happens there.

"i20506","t19320710393158","I will explain in brief one central idea about education which
has been dominating my thoughts as I am writing the history of the
Ashram. Some persons see  a  deficiency  in  the  Ashram,  namely,
absence  of  any  arrangement  for  education,  that  is,  for  literary
education. I also can see this deficiency. But it will probably remain as
long as the Ashram lasts. I will not here go into the reasons for that.
People see this deficiency because we do not know the true
meaning of education and the right method of acquiring it, or we
assume that the existing system of imparting education is the right
one. According to me, the present idea of education and the method
of imparting and receiving it are both faulty.
True education is that which helps us to know the atman, our
true self, God and Truth. To acquire this knowledge, some persons
may feel the need for a study of literature, some for a study of
physical sciences and  some  others  for  art.  But  every  branch  of
knowledge should have as its goal knowledge of the self. That is so in
the Ashram. We carry on numerous activities with that aim in view. All
of them are, in my sense of the term, true education. Those activities
can also be carried on without any reference to the goal of knowledge
of the self. When they are so carried on, they may serve as a means of
livelihood or of something else, but they are not education. In an
activity  carried  on  as  education,  a  proper  understanding  of  its
meaning, devotion to duty and the spirit of service are necessary. The
first necessarily brings about development of the intellect. In doing
any piece of work, however small, we should be inspired by a holy
aim and, while doing it, we should try to understand the purpose
which it will serve and the scientific method of doing it. There is a
science of every type of work—whether it be cooking, sanitation,
carpentry or spinning. Everybody who does his work with the attitude
of a student knows its science or discovers it.
If the inmates of the Ashram understand this, they would see
that the Ashram  is a  great  school  in  which  the  inmates  receive
1 This was sent along with “Letter to Narandas Gandhi”, 6/10-7-1932; vide the
following item.
THE COLLECTED WORKS  OF MAHATMA  GANDHI
education not for a few hours only but all the time. Every person
who lives in the Ashram to attain knowledge of the self—of Truth—is
both a teacher and a pupil. He is a teacher in regard to what he knows,
and a pupil in regard to anything about which he needs to learn. If we
know more than our neighbour about anything, we should willingly
share our knowledge with him, and equally willingly receive from him
what he knows more than we do. If we thus regularly  exchange
knowledge with others, we would not feel the absence of teachers, and
education would become a painless and spontaneous process. The
most important education is the training of character. As we advance
in our observance of yamaniyamas, our capacity for learning—for
knowing Truth—will go on increasing.
What about literary education, then? It is no more a question.
The rule for this is the same as for the other activities. The method
explained above  dispenses with one superstition,  namely,  that  for
education we require a separate building known as school and  a
teacher to teach. When the desire for literary education awakens in us,
we should know that we shall have to acquire it through self-help.
There is ample scope for this in the Ashram. If I have been able to
explain above my idea clearly, literary education should no more be a
problem. Those who possess it should take  every  opportunity  to
impart it to others and the latter should receive it from them.

The standards are amended from time to time by the UGC in view of changing needs in higher education. Further, under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) of Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) strategic funding is given to States for establishing Universities by conversion of autonomous colleges or clustering of Colleges. The extant guidelines approved by the National Mission Authority of RUSA, lay stress on quality of candidate institutions for conversion or clustering into universities and the criteria have not been relaxed.(c) to (e): The issue of the Central Government permitting State Government to set up new Universities does not arise as State Legislatures are competent to establish State Universities. The Central Government through the University Grants Commission (UGC) is concerned with the maintenance of standards in education by State Universities. The Bills for setting up of State Universities and the accompanying reasons undergo the scrutiny of State Legislature. The Central Government has not laid down comprehensive norms for such legislation. Under RUSA, funding can be considered for universities created by upgrading autonomous colleges or by clustering of colleges as per RUSA norms. The respective State Bills for setting up of such universities need to satisfy the RUSA norms if funding under RUSA is contemplated by the State.","minister","ls16","2015","201512","20151207","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2015","236873","301375","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","smtsmritizubinirani","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2015","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2015","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2015","l16_nt_2015","bjp_qna_2015","bjp_nt_2015","other","n201512","l16_qna_201512","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","HumanResourceDevelopment","awhethertheGovernmenthasrelaxedtherulesandregulationsforsettingupofnewuniversitiesbytheStateGovernmentsbifsothedetailsthereofcwhethertheGovernmenthaspermittedStateGovernmentstosetupnewUniversitiesdespitethefactthatexistinguniversitiesarefacinghugefinancialdifficultiesdifsothedetailsthereofandethenormsadoptedbytheStateGovernmentstosetupnewUniversitiesinthecountry","newdelhi",236

The non-Plan expenditure has increased by Rs.17,616
crore. There is a shortfall of Rs.3,631 crore under Plan. The normal non-Plan expenditure
of the Government departments has increased only by Rs.2,539 crore. The other increases
are on account of loans to States and UTs against net Small Savings collections, Rs.9,588
crore, pension, Rs.2,711 crore, interest payments, Rs.2,248 crore, and postal deficit,
Rs.530 crore.
Net tax revenues for the Centre are estimated at Rs.1,09,537 crore
against Rs.1,16,857 crore budgeted, reflecting a shortfall of Rs.7,320 crore. The
shortfall is mainly due to lower customs revenue on account of both lower volume and
unit-price of imports and lower excise revenue resulting from low industrial growth.
Disinvestment receipts are expected to be Rs.8,000 crore against Rs.5,000 crore budgeted.
The fiscal deficit is thus likely to increase to 6.5% of GDP from
the budget target of 5.6% on the basis of comparable GDP estimates. However, if the
increase over budget in small savings loans to States and Union Territories is excluded,
the adjusted fiscal deficit would be 5.9%.","admin","budgets","1999","199901","19990101","199900","na","nda1","nationalpol","speech","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","english","xxxx","wwwindiabudgetgovinbspeechphp","ubs1999","76","57265","notrans","sushrija","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","budget","others","others","tech","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","ubs_spe","na","yes","others","na","bjp","ubs_nt","ubs_nda1","bjp_spe","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","na_spe","na_nt","na_nda1","adm1999","adm_spe","adm_nt","adm_nda1","ubs","ubs","ubs","ubs","ubs","ubs","ubs","ubs","ubs","adm","adm","adm","adm","adm","adm","adm","adm","adm","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","ubs","adm","others","ubs","adm","others","ubs","adm","others","ubs","adm","others","ubs_spe","adm_spe","o_spe","ubs_nt","adm_nt","o_nt","ubs_nda1","adm_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","english","budgetspeeches_aft1996","ubs","nt","spe","na","bjp_ubs","bjp_spe","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_ubs","lib_spe","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib1999","lib_bjp_spe","ubs_spe_1999","ubs_nt_1999","bjp_spe_1999","bjp_nt_1999","other","n199901","ubs_spe_199901","ubs_spe","ubs_spe_l","ubs_spe_l","ubs_nt_l","adm_spe_l","adm_nt_l","ubs","ubs","ubs_l","ubs_l","ubs","ubs","ubs_l","ubs_l","H","H","Hl","Hl",NA,NA,NA,204

As prediction of earthquake is not possible there is need to take preparatory measures like earthquake resistant constructions adoption of building Codes/Guidelines/standards retrofitting public education and community awareness. State Governments have been requested by the concerned agencies for taking necessary preparatory measures in the earthquake vulnerable areas. Vulnerability atlas for the country as well as State-wise has also been brought out with regard to earthquake cyclone and flood disasters. States falling in seismic zones 4 & 5 have been requested to update their Contingency Action Plan in the context of recent earthquake of Gujarat and initiate necessary measures with emphasis on preparedness and mitigation. In the event of earthquake of Gujarat a National Committee on Disaster Management has been set up under the Chairmanship of Hon_ble Prime Minister having the representatives of the Presidents of the National and State level Political Parties. The National Committee will inter-alia suggest the necessary institutional and legislative measures needed for an effective and long term strategy to deal with major natural calamities in the future.

"i30043","t19370925418588","A correspondent asks the following four questions:
1. Hindus who once renounced their faith for some reason or other and
joined Islam or Christianity sincerely repent and want to come back. Should
we re-convert them or not? You may take  the  instance  of  your  own  son
Harilal.1
2. Lakhs of the Depressed Class people in South India, as you know,
have joined Christianity wholesale.  Some  of  them,  since the  Travancore
Durbar Declaration2 and the  popularity  of  the  Harijan  movement,  feel  it
worthwhile to re-adopt their ancestral faith. What would you advise  about
3.  A Hindu was made  to  join  another  faith  for  certain  material
considerations. After some time he feels disillusioned and comes and knocks
at our door. Shall we welcome him or not?
4. Young Hindu boys and girls are often taken hold of by Christian
missionaries and converted. At some places Muslims are also making use of
their orphanages for this purpose. What should we do, when these boys and
girls, either alone or with their guardians, approach us for shuddhi?
These, or such questions, have been asked and answered before
now in these columns in some shape or other. I do not need to answer
each separately. In my opinion they are not examples of real heart
conversion. If a person, through fear, compulsion, starvation or for
material gain or consideration, goes over to another faith, it is a
misnomer to call it conversion. Most cases of mass conversion, of
which we have heard so much during the past two years, have been to
my mind false coin. Real conversion springs from the heart and at the
prompting of God, not of a stranger. The voice of God can always be
distinguished from the voice of man. The hypothetical cases coined
by my correspondent are, so far as I can see, not cases of conversion. I
would, therefore, unhesitatingly re-admit to the Hindu fold all such
repentants without ado, certainly without any shuddhi. Shuddhi is  not
applicable to such cases. And, as I believe in the equality of all the
great religions of the earth, I regard no man as polluted because he
has forsaken the branch on which he was sitting and gone over to
another of the same tree. If he comes back to the original branch, he
deserves to be welcomed and not told that he had committed a sin by
reason of his having forsaken the family to which he belonged. In so
far as he may be deemed to have erred, he has sufficiently purged
himself of it when he repents of the error and retraces his step.

"i52504","t20031110546946","I extend a warm welcome to all of you for this Third Meet of the High Level Group on Education for All. I would like to congratulate UNESCO for setting up this monitoring mechanism to ensure that the Education for All movement not only remains on track, but also gains momentum.

True education is that unique key which can open many doors simultaneously ' individual's all–round development, economic progress of the family and the nation, harmony and kinship among diverse groups in a society, and peace and cooperation among members of the international community. In modern times, the importance of education has increased immensely. This is because of the realization among developing countries that non–achievement of the goal of universal education is one of the principal reasons for their poverty, unsatisfactory performance in human development, and inability to engage with the developed nations on equal terms.

Those countries that have acted on this realization have found that literacy and education have a direct role in human development and are instrumental in facilitating other achievements. To use a terminology from economics, the return on investments in education has been found to be one of the highest.

However, the goal of universal education cannot be seen to be the concern of individual countries and their governments alone. It is accepted as one of the paramount goals of the global community. Right to Education was articulated as far back as in 1948 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Most recently, the United Nations showed a new sense of urgency when, at its Millennium Summit three years ago, it adopted the goal of Halving Global Poverty by 2015.

This sense of urgency is fully reflected in what we in India have been doing in the field of education. A revolutionary step was taken last year when free and compulsory education was made a Fundamental Right by amending the Constitution with the universal support of Parliamentarians and the civil society. To translate this commitment into action, we have launched a comprehensive programme called Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan for education of all children in the age group 6 to 14 years. It is the largest and the most ambitious educational programme in India since Independence. It not only aims at getting all the 190 million children spread over one million habitations into school, but also retaining them there for eight years once they come to school.

India has achieved a significant success in reducing illiteracy ' especially female illiteracy ' in the past decade. Our mission is now moving much faster than ever before.

In our effort to achieve the goal of Education for All, developing countries have to determine how to overcome several old constraints and how best to deal with certain new realities. The biggest constraint is poverty itself. Education reduces poverty. But poverty also reduces access to education.

Making elementary education free is no doubt a necessary step, but it is not sufficient. We have to properly implement other useful interventions such as the Mid–Day Meal Scheme. Experience has shown that wherever this scheme is effectively implemented, the dropout rate has come down and children have performed better.

Another constraint that the movement for Education for All has faced is social in nature. Owing to a number of historical and cultural factors, certain sections of society in many developing countries have lagged behind in education. We in India have attempted to undo such wrongs through affirmative action. We have achieved positive results. However, both governmental and societal efforts have to be intensified to reach education to scheduled castes and tribes, certain minorities, and children with disabilities.

Similarly, serious and sustained attention has to be paid to education of the girl child. Gender gaps persist in those countries that have shown major gains in enrolment and retention. A number of socio–cultural, economic and school–related factors are responsible for this. We have to address parental indifference towards girls' education. Even though governmental initiatives have brought down the cost of educating girls, it is the opportunity cost of sending girls to school that is acting as a major deterrent to their education. Girls are employed in a variety of economic activities, which are crucial to poor families as it has a bearing on family livelihood. Within the family, a girl child often has the responsibility of sibling care and household work. Therefore, our educational programmes have to be so designed and implemented that they cover all girls, in spite of these factors.

There is another factor, which is often overlooked. In many rural areas and urban slums, the school environment is still not conducive to learning. Absence of clean drinking water, toilets, and boundary walls tend to keep children, especially girls away from school.

We need to address each of these issues in a focussed manner and come up with solutions for each of the inhibiting factors. Only then would half of the world's population be in a position to enjoy the right to education. In India we have kept this in mind and introduced a number of gender–specific schemes. Even our general schemes like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan have a strong gender focus. With these interventions, our gender indicators are showing improvement and we are confident of achieving the Education for All goals well before the 2015 deadline.

All the requirements that I have mentioned require funds. While social and philanthropic contribution to education should be fully encouraged, it is obvious that governments have to bear the main responsibility of funding school education for the poor. A programme for ensuring that all children have access to education cannot be allowed to suffer from lack of funds. The donor countries and institutions made a commitment at Dakar in the year 2000 that no country seriously committed to basic education will be thwarted in the achievement of this goal by lack of resources. Now is the time to redeem this pledge.

However, I am afraid the Fast Track Initiative started by the international funding agencies in 2002 has so far been neither fast nor adequate. We need to accelerate the process if we wish to ensure that we do not slip on the deadlines set at Dakar in 2000.

I mentioned that we have to recognize the new reality in which the goal of universal education is being pursued. And that is the reality of the growing awareness about quality in education. Even poor families are no longer satisfied with their children merely going to any school. They want them to go to a good school and get a good education. Hence, the poor are right in demanding not simply Education for All, but Quality Education for All.

However, realization of this right is becoming increasingly difficult in the fast–changing economic scenario. Market forces are shaping the growth of all layers of education, including elementary education. Over the past few decades, economic barriers preventing access to quality education for the masses have tended to rise. The difference between the poor man's school and the rich man's school is becoming starker with each passing year. Since quality education is crucial for capturing the opportunities in the emerging Knowledge Economy, this difference will further widen the already unacceptable divide between the haves and have–nots.

This provides an added reason why governments have to continue to play a major role to ensure that quality education is brought within the reach of the common man. The rights of poor children have to be protected from the working of market forces. I would like this meet to deliberate on how best to achieve this objective.

I am told that there are also certain issues relating to the WTO negotiations under General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which adversely affect the campaign to realize the goal of Education for All. Perhaps the High Level Group needs to flag these issues for detailed discussion.

The Third High–Level group is meeting at the right time in our march towards the goal of Education for All. We need to review the progress we have made so far, analyse the problems and obstacles, and chart a reliable path for faster progress in the future. I am confident that your deliberations over the next two days would be fruitful. I wish you the best in this endeavour.","pms","vajpayee","2003","200311","20031110","pmo","thirdterm","nda1","nationalpol","speech","other","other","other","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","na","xxxxx","httparchivepmonicinabvspeechdetailsphpnodeid9260","abv2003","2601","2601","notrans","collective","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","vajpayee","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","abv_spe","na","yes","others","m","bjp","abv_nt","abv_nda1","bjp_spe","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","m_spe","m_nt","m_nda1","pms2003","pms_spe","pms_nt","pms_nda1","abv","abv","abv","abv","abv","abv","abv","abv","abv","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","abv","pms","others","abv","pms","others","abv","pms","others","abv","pms","others","abv_spe","pms_spe","o_spe","abv_nt","pms_nt","o_nt","abv_nda1","pms_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","na","pms","abv","nt","spe","t","bjp_abv","bjp_spe","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_abv","lib_spe","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2003","lib_bjp_spe","abv_spe_2003","abv_nt_2003","bjp_spe_2003","bjp_nt_2003","other","o200311","abv_spe_200311","abv_spe","abv_spe","abv_spe","abv_nt","pms_spe","pms_nt","abv_spe","abv_spe","abv_spe","abv_spe","abv_s","abv_s","abv_s","abv_s","Vs","Vs","Vs","Vs",NA,NA,NA,1390

Devdas is just now at Deolali nursing Mathuradas, but he has
left with me a letter of yours to him containing a question to be
answered. If a person who wears khadi exclusively and on all
occasions is once in a way compelled, by force of circumstances, to
use some other cloth, would he still be regarded a”habitual wearer of
khadi”2? My answer is that he should undoubtedly be regarded
a”habitual wearer”3. I have an impression, however, that I had already
answered this question for you.

Was a settlement reached in the Sholapur dispute, or is it still
hanging fire?

I am keeping well, and have almost regained the weight lost
during the fast.

Someone on your behalf gave me a basket of fruit on my way
to Kanpur.

This will contribute to accelerating rural development and rural employment, as well as narrowing the gap between backward and more advanced areas of the country. The programme consists of two funding windows namely, (a) a capability Building Fund of Rs.250 crore per annum and (b) a substantially untied developmental grant of Rs.3500 crore for 2006-07. Every district is to receive a fixed minimum amount of Rs.10 crore per annum under the programme.50% of the balance allocation under this programme is allocated on the basis of the share of the population and area of the district in the total population and area of all backward districts. The developmental fund under the programme can be used for filling the critical gaps in development which remain despite other major interventions. Panchayats and Urban Local Bodies may use these funds for any purpose within the items that are devolved to them as listed in the Eleventh and Twelfth schedule of the Constitution respectively. The employment opportunity and other benefits accruing to backward districts would flow from the individual plans prepared by each district. However, each district is expected to undertake a diagnostic study of its backwardness and prepare a well conceived participative district development plan in accordance with its requirements.","minister","ls14","2007","200703","20070321","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2007","135147","175579","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrimanishankaraiyar","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2007","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2007","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2007","l14_nt_2007","inc_qna_2007","inc_nt_2007","other","n200703","l14_qna_200703","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","PanchayatiRaj","awhetherthereisanyproposaltosetuparuralareaassistancefundforprovidingemploymentassistancetobackwarddistrictsinthecountrybifsothedetailsthereofctheemploymentopportunitieslikelytobegeneratedasaresultthereofanddtheotherbenefitslikelytobeaccurredtothebackwarddistricts","newdelhi",241

"i77879","t20190101489820","20th FIMMDA - PDAI Annual Conference, Moscow, August 31, 2019 

1. I am happy to be here today amidst you and I must thank FIMMDA and PDAI for 
this privilege. The annual conference of FIMMDA and PDAI has of late been known 
as much for the content of the deliberations as for the choice of the venues, and 
the present one, its twentieth edition, is no exception. These occasions bring 
together the best minds in the financial market, particularly the fixed income 
segment, under one roof and provides excellent platform for deliberating on 
contemporary issues facing the markets. It is an important platform for us in the 
Reserve Bank to share our views on topics of current relevance with the market 
participants who have a vital role in, and responsibility for, driving growth and 
development. 
 

2. FIMMDA is a representative body of participants in the fixed income market in 
India. I am happy to note that unlike many such organizations around the world, 
FIMMDA is much less an interest group, and has over the years played a key role 
in developments of the markets. It has ably contributed to our efforts towards 
building deep and liquid fixed income markets including derivative markets. But for 
the role it has played in the spheres of valuation, price dissemination, product 
evolution, benchmark development, assimilation of best practices and market 
education, we would be well short of being one of the most evolved of fixed income 
markets among the emerging economies that we are today. Similarly, PDAI has 
played a seminal role in development of the primary market in government debt 
over the last two decades, and the successive successful issuances of government 
debt owes a great deal to the community of primary dealers.   
 

3. The importance of the fixed income markets cannot be over emphasized. Apart 
from the fact that these markets meet the funds requirement of the sovereign and 
sub-sovereign bodies across the globe, they also substantially meet the external 
funds requirements of financial as well as non-financial firms. Further, these 
markets are also intimately linked with the funding requirement of individuals- 
education finance, home finance, consumption finance and so on- in several ways 
from providing pricing benchmark to providing funding for the institutions that 
provide primary funding. Quite obviously, the aggregate value of outstanding fixed 
income instruments is estimated to be in excess of USD 100 trillion in contrast with 
the value of the global stock market around USD 70 trillion. The daily trading 
volume of the fixed income instruments also exceeds that in the stock market by a 
factor of three. Though US continues to account for a large part of the global fixed 
income market, the fact that the global market size has trebled during the last 
fifteen years seems to indicate that the other jurisdictions are catching up. 
 

4. Of the two non-equity sources of external funding for the corporate sector, viz., 
bank finance and market-based finance, the literature seems to find the latter the 
preferred mode from a systemic viewpoint. Without going into this debate, we can 
perhaps say that the two play a complementary role. The Indian financial sector 
which mostly has been a bank-based one needs to develop a robust fixed income 
market to bring in market discipline, to augment bank finance and indeed free up 
bank finance for uses that cannot access the market directly. Development of the 
fixed income market has been an important objective of the Reserve Bank, the 
Government, the SEBI and other regulators these many years. Significant 
progress has been made, yet a lot remains to be achieved.  
 

5. What are the attributes of the market we aspire to have? There are many ways to 
describe an efficient and robust market; but we can underscore four aspects. 
 

a. Firstly, there must be wide range of products available. It is nowhere more 
pronounced as in the financial markets because it is well recognized that a 
wide array of securities enable the economic agents to better deal with the 
uncertainty of the future.  
 

b. Secondly, there must be transparency. The financial market is 
characterized by information asymmetry, both pre and post transaction. The 
borrower or investee always knows more about itself than the lender or the 
investor. The markets use various mechanisms to address this problem. 
Financial disclosures and ratings are two most common means, the integrity 
of which is critical to a well-functioning financial market. 

 
c. Thirdly, there must be liquidity. A market without liquidity serves no purpose. 

A liquid market spurs production and consumption; in financial markets, 
liquidity facilitates savings and investment. Liquidity is often seen as 
synonymous with trading volumes, but as has been pointed out since the 
times of Keynes, volumes brought on by transient investors driven by 
speculative short-term gains may not necessarily bring efficiency to the 
market. Liquidity essentially means easy and frictionless entry into and exit 
out of investment positions without loss of value. Several prerequisites 
underpin this: large number of participants, fewer barriers to entry, large 
volume of transactions, pricing efficiency, absence of risk-free arbitrage and 
so on. 

 
d. Lastly, there must be efficient risk management. As the financial crisis has 

demonstrated, a market without adequate risk management measures is 
prone to failure with enormous economic and social cost. I had mentioned 
earlier about the range of financial products, the caveat is that the 
complexity of these should not run ahead of the understanding of their risk 
implications. Measures like move to exchange traded products, central 
counterparty clearing, bilateral margining and reporting positions to trade 
repositories are aimed at improving the risk management practices. 

 
6. How do our fixed income markets perform against these standards? Let me list 

some stylized facts. 
 

a. Government securities, that constitute the largest segment of the fixed 
income market, stand at about ` 58 trillion, treasury bills accounting for 
another about ` 6 trillion. Though the primary issuances have been quite 
seamless, only the 10 year benchmark security accounts for bulk of the 
trading volumes. Indeed, liquidity in this bench mark security as represented 
by the bid-ask spread is impressive, and according to a recent BIS study, 
among the best amongst emerging markets. Liquidity, however, almost 
completely dries off in other off-benchmark securities, which does not reflect 
well on the market. 
 

b. The corporate debt market has registered impressive growth. In the five 
years between June 2014 and June 2019, the market size has grown from 
` 14.43 trillion to ` 30.63 trillion. Out of this, the size of structured notes 
market has grown from ` 8.78 billion to ` 230 billion1. These figures 
underscore the growing maturity of the market. We must however note that 
there are in excess of 24000 instruments outstanding, reducing the average 
outstanding per instrument to a small figure. On the other hand, the 
issuances in recent times have been predominantly (upto 75%) by the 
financial firms. Besides, most of the issuances have been through private 
placement. The secondary market in corporate debt is so illiquid that we can 
very well say there is no such market. The rating transition of some 
corporate debt, particularly those issued by financial firms, has been 
phenomenal – from sound credit to junk. 

 
c. The evolution of the money market continues to be stunted. Most of the 

activity is concentrated in the overnight segment and a robust term money 
market continues to elude us. There is some trading in the treasury bills, but 
activity in the CPs and CDs is confined to primary issuances.  

 
d. The interest rate derivatives market also continues to be lackluster. There 
is reasonable liquidity in overnight interest swaps, but there is no appetite, 
and hence not much trading in other derivatives including interest rate 
futures. The Credit Default Swap market, introduced in 2012 is moribund. It 
is ironical that while some participants used to write little understood 
products like quanto swaps a decade and a half back, there is little effort to 
provide simple products like caps or collars on bonds today. 

 
e. Despite allowing full access to non-resident investors to the domestic 
interest rate derivatives market, anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that 
an offshore market in this segment might be developing, much like the NDF 
market. 

 
7. I now come to the important question of what needs to be done? We must 
understand that development of markets is a complex process. An economy 
aspiring for faster development, does have financing needs. There is domestic 
savings augmented by the foreign savings to fulfill the financing needs. It is for the 
market to perform an efficient role in allocation. Development of markets is not 
driven by altruism; it requires alignment of incentives of all stakeholders – the 
investor, the investee as well as the regulator. The incentives of the first two are 
well appreciated, but the regulator is often seen as a spoilsport in the process of 
development of markets. It must be appreciated that the regulator’s objective is 
financial stability, avoidance of market failures and consumer protection, and the 
financial crisis has underscored the importance of these objectives. Even as the 
regulatory framework keeps evolving, are there other aspects to look at? 
 
a. One of the most important prerequisites of a liquid and robust market is wide 

participation by agents with large volumes of merchandise. In this respect, 
banks constitute the single largest set of entities followed by insurance 
companies, pension funds, and now alternative investment funds. It has been 
generally observed that such of these entities as have large balance sheet, 
large holding of government securities are not very active either in markets or 
in innovation. There is perhaps a need to go beyond the comfort of 6-9-3 
banking in search of unexploited market and unharvested returns. We would 
also work towards enhancing the overall liquidity in Government securities 
market in terms of availability of two-way quotes in less liquid maturities through 
targeted market making schemes. Further, measures towards activation of a 
securities lending and borrowing programme, inter-operability of depositories 
for smooth transfer of ownership in securities will receive our attention. We are 
also engaging Government for active consolidation of Government debt 
through frequent buyback/switch operation. 
 

b. It is recognized that non-resident investors bring volume and liquidity to the 
financial markets for the simple reason that there is a large corpus of savings 
available overseas, forever in search of yields. There has been a gradual effort 
to remove the barriers to entry for NR investors in the debt segment. The 
gradual process is motivated by the possibility of sudden reversals causing 
turbulence in the interest rates. Even though there has been a great deal of 
interest from foreign investors in Rupee debt securities in recent times which 
protects the Indian borrower from foreign exchange risk in contrast with foreign 
currency debts, the threat to stability in the interest rate market and some 
residual threat to stability in the forex market remains. Be that as it may, greater 
access to foreign investors to the rupee debt market – cash as well as derivative 
will gradually be considered. 

 
c. It is estimated that five years down the line, the demand for bonds will 

significantly outstrip the supply. It is a paradoxical situation. Is the market 
barring borrowers from the market? The issues relating to CDS comes to mind. 
The basic purpose of CDS was to enable lower rated borrowers to access the 
market while the investor is protected against default by buying a CDS. But in 
a market, where only highly rated entities issue bonds, there will be no need 
for a CDS or rather, a CDS will leave nothing on the table for the investors, in 
comparison with a government security. Bringing liquidity into this and other 
derivative product needs introspection. 

 
d. The risk management at market level is pretty robust, with central counterparty 

settlement, exchange traded products, trade repositories, legal entity identifier, 
etc. But there is scope of improvement at entity level as far as financial 
institutions are concerned, which will be tested with introduction of new 
accounting standards. Some other aspects of regulation – e.g., treatment of 
cash margins as deposits, payment of interest on such margins, posting of 
collateral abroad – are all under examination to enable participants to move to 
global margining standards.  

 
e. IRDA, SEBI and PFRDA too could help development of interest rate markets. 
For instance, short selling activity could benefit if a wider pool of securities 
lenders can be developed. Insurance and pension funds, mutual funds have 
significant holdings of Government securities that could be used to lent to short 
sellers. This would avoid short-squeeze incident we saw a couple of years 
back, apart from generating income for these entities. We are working with 
regulators to develop a securities lending product that could enable these 
entities to participate in securities lending.  

 
f. On a more general note, one of FIMMDA’s important function has been to 
organize market feedback on policy initiatives. This is a great help for regulators 
to assess the impact of regulations, especially at the proposal stage. While this 
should continue, I would be really happy if FIMMDA and its members make 
efforts to identify market development initiatives and bring it to the notice of the 
regulators. On a lighter vein, market is known to run ahead of regulators while 
the latter try to catch up. While this is not what I can encourage you to do, I do 
appreciate that market alone can foster innovative ideas and shall expect you 
to engage with regulators in regard to the steps that we can jointly take.  

 
g. Ordinarily, in so far as the trades are between informed participants who are 
capable of comprehending and defending their interests, the regulator should 
not be concerned about the fairness of pricing. Nevertheless, fair pricing is a 
sound principle in any market, often threatened by the fact that there are few 
sellers. I expect FIMMDA, with its expertise in valuation and role as a market 
developer will keep a close eye on this. 

 
h. There have been discussions about market timings of various segments of 
financial markets. Taking into account the representations received from the 
market, we are examining current market timings with respect to trading, 
clearing and settlement cycles of financial markets regulated by the Reserve 
Bank to improve market efficiency.  

i. Financial Market Infrastructures play a critical role in the financial system and 
the broader economy. These infrastructures facilitate the clearing and 
settlement of monetary and other  financial transactions, such as payments, 
securities, and derivative contracts (including derivatives contracts for 
commodities). The central bank of any country is usually the driving force in the 
development of national payment systems. The Reserve Bank of India has 
been playing this  developmental  role  and  has  taken  several  initiatives  for  
Safe,  Secure,  Sound,  Efficient, Accessible  and  Authorized  payment  
systems  in  the  country.  In this context, I would briefly outline the 
developments taking place in this space. 
 

j. At the heart of payment market infrastructures (PMIs) is the one owned by 
central banks which the world over is a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) 
system. As the world moves closer to real time everything, including payments 
and the inflection on innovation, better governance and wider access, the role 
of the RTGS system is evolving. This places new demands on the business 
and technology architectures of PMIs and RTGS systems in particular. To 
move closer to providing access to the RTGS for longer durations, the customer 
timings have been recently extended. There has been a growing demand for 
providing wider access to the RTGS system and allow participation of non-
banks. The High-Level Committee on Deepening of Digital Payments (CDDP) 
recommended that non-banking entities should be included as associate 
members of payment systems and become an active player in enhancing 
acceptance infrastructure in the country. The recommendations are under 
examination.  
 

k. Another development in the markets is related to implementation of Legal Entity 
Identifier (LEI). In view of the financial crises across the world, LEI has provided 
a way to identify financial connections so that regulators and firms can better 
understand the true nature of risk exposures across the financial system. In 
India, LEI has been mandated across various sectors in the financial markets 
including derivatives and non-derivatives market and also for large corporate 
borrowers. This is being implemented in a phased manner. Since it has been 
made mandatory for large corporate borrowers to obtain LEI, banks should, 
apart from advising such borrowers to obtain LEI, encourage such borrowers 
to obtain LEI for their parent entity as well as all subsidiaries and associates. 
Implementation of LEI for large borrowers may help banks in better monitoring 
of transactions and hence, exposure of such borrowers across nations. 

8. Let me now conclude. The role of financial sector in a growing economy cannot be 
overemphasized. As the most important segment, the fixed income market in India 
has to grow to cater to the investment needs of an economy that aspires to become 
a USD 5 trillion economy in near future. While the RBI and other sister regulators 
will continue to draw the contours of growth with financial stability in mind, the 
market needs more activity, innovation and enterprise from the community of 
participants in this market.  

I hope that you will keep this refrain in mind when you discuss the markets in this

"i536028","t20090710562424","  (a) & (b): As reported by the RBI, outstanding gross bank credit of Scheduled Commercial Banks registered a positive year-on-year growth of 28.5% in 2007, 22.8% in 2008 and 19.3% in 2009.(c) & (d): During the financial year ending 2009, credit growth of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) was higher compared to Private Sector Banks and Foreign Banks. The variation in credit growth could be on account of several factors including the business model followed by the concerned banks and their exposure to risk in a given economic scenario.(e): The banking sector is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Government has no influence or direct role to play in the credit growth of private and foreign banks as their business growth is decided by their respective boards. In the case of Public Sector Banks (PSBs), however, bank-wise credit targets are jointly decided by the Government and the bank concerned. In the Financial Year 2009, PSBs as a group were able to achieve the overall credit target set by the Government.","minister","ls15","2009","200907","20090710","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2009","215181","198336","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrinamonarainmeena","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2009","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2009","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2009","l15_nt_2009","inc_qna_2009","inc_nt_2009","other","n200907","l15_qna_200907","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","Finance","awhethertheamountofloansdisbursedbythebankshasshownincreaseeveryyearduringthelastthreeyearsbifsotherateofgrowthintheloanamountforthesaidperiodcwhetherthereisavariationingrowthrateamongthepublicsectorbanksprivatesectorbanksandforeignbanksdifsothereasonsthereforandethestepsbeingtakenbytheGovernmenttoremovevariationsingrowthrate","newdelhi",180

Minimum wages fixed by the appropriate Governments under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 in respect of scheduled employments under their respective jurisdiction are also applicable to those engaged on daily basis. The Act provides for revision of minimum wages at an interval not exceeding five years. Whenever minimum wages have a Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA) component, the VDA is revised periodically twice a year.","minister","ls14","2007","200709","20070903","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2007","81160","181567","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","independentcharge","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2007","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2007","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2007","l14_nt_2007","inc_qna_2007","inc_nt_2007","other","n200709","l14_qna_200709","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","LabourandEmployment","awhetherthewagesandotherfacilitiesavailabletotheagriculturallabourersaremuchlessascomparedtotheircounterpartsinorganizedsectorbifsothedetailsthereofandreasonsthereforandcthestepsbeingtakenbytheGovernmenttoensureequitablewagesandfacilitiestotheagriculturallabourers","newdelhi",166

"i5311","t19180609446030","DEAR MR. ROBERTSON,

I am sorry I was away when your note1 was received. I feel that I
should not speak to the resolution. I hope therefore that His
Excellency will excuse me. I observe that my name is included in the
man-power committee. I note that men like Mr. Tilak are not
included. I fear that my usefulness will be materially curtailed if I
could not have the benefit of his co-operation and that of other Home
Rulers of his calibre. It is hopeless to expect a truly national response
and a national army, unless the Government are prepared to trust them
to do their duty. I should gladly serve on the man-power committee if
these leaders are invited to join it. If additions to the committee can be
moved, I would be prepared to move that some of these gentlemen
may be included in one or more of these committees.

Yours sincerely,

As per the latest survey results published for July, 2008, the BCI declined by about 15% or 22.9 points over the previous quarter. The NCAER survey also highlights that, despite the lower overall business confidence, there is expectation of positive sales and growth in output. The indicators point to slower growth in exports and imports than sales and production. In other words, the domestic markets are expected to be stronger than the global demand conditions.(c)As there could be spill over effects of the slowdown in global growth on the domestic economy, the Reserve Bank of India and the Government have initiated monetary and fiscal measures which address the concerns of the stakeholders in the growth process.","minister","ls14","2008","200812","20081212","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2008","86297","194629","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","expenditurebankinginsurance","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2008","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2008","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2008","l14_nt_2008","inc_qna_2008","inc_nt_2008","other","n200812","l14_qna_200812","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","Finance","awhetherNationalCouncilofAppliedEconomicResearchhasmadeanysurveyonbusinessconfidenceindexrecentlybifsothedetailsthereofandcthereactionoftheGovernmentthereto","newdelhi",148
"i30339","t19380218052714","The fear that I had entertained about the unwarranted inter-
ference by Governors or the Viceroy with the due course of provincial
autonomy has been justified in an unexpected manner. I can only
hope that what I regard as a grievous error may be somehow or other
rectified. I hope that there is nothing to warrant another fear that has
possessed me, namely, that the British authority has been getting tired,
perhaps  also  alarmed,  over  the  headway  Congress  and  Congress
Ministers are making along constructive lines. And yet it is most
difficult for me to realize that the Viceroy would allow a grave crisis
to be created over what must be in his estimation a paltry matter. I
have read and pondered over Section 126 (5) of the Government of
India Act. The Governor-General is authorized by that Section to use
his discretion “for the purpose of preventing any grave menace to the
peace or tranquillity of India or any part thereof”. Many prisoners
convicted for crimes of violence in pursuit of a political motive have
been discharged before now and during the period of office of the
Congress  Ministries.  I  do  not  know  that  any  menace  grave  or
otherwise has been thereby created in respect of peace or tranquillity
in any single part of India. Congress Ministers throughout the seven
Provinces have given ample testimony of their readiness and ability to
cope with forces of disorder. The Congress stands more to lose than
Government if during its regime in any Province disorders take place.
I understand that the Ministers in  the  Provinces  concerned  have,
previously to asking for discharge of prisoners, assured themselves of
the change of mentality of the prisoners.  Surely,  it  is they  who
according to law are in the first instance responsible for law and order.
The Governor and the whole weight of British might is always in
reserve, if in spite of the efforts of the Congress Ministers disorders
take place, with its well-known efficiency in suppressing disorders
when they actually take place. Surely, there was no warrant whatsoever
for interference with the deliberate decision of the Congress Ministers
in  the  matter  under  discussion.  I  cannot  help  thinking  that  the
Ministers who have resigned have taken, under instruction from the
Working Committee, the only honourable course open to them.

Setting up of new ROs by OMCs at identified locations is an ongoing business activity based on commercial considerations.

However from the available figures it has been observed that during the current year the total earnings from the passenger traffic for the months of April-June 2000 was higher as compared to that of the previous year.","minister","ls13","2000","200008","20000817","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2000","55164","70694","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shridigvijaysingh","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2000","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2000","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2000","l13_nt_2000","bjp_qna_2000","bjp_nt_2000","other","n200008","l13_qna_200008","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","Railways","awhethertheGovernmenthaveassessedtheperformanceintermsofreturnsanticipatedandactuallyreceivedfromrunningofSummerSpecialTrainsbifsothedetailsthereofzonewisecwhethertherevenueearnedfromSummerSpecialTrainswasmuchbelowtheexpectedleveldifsothedetailsthereofalongwiththereasonsthereforeandethestepstakenproposedtobetakenforrealisticassessmentofsummertrafficinfuture","newdelhi",123

There are no global standards for setting up of post offices per person. However, opening of new post offices in uncovered & justified areas in India is an ongoing process subject to fulfillment of the prescribed norms related to distance, population, income and subject to availability of funds and manpower. The norms for opening of post offices are at Annexure- I.(b) Yes Madam. Provisions of ATMs and savings bank are made in post offices. As on 09/03/2017, 976 ATMs have been installed. The State-wise details are at Annexure-II. ANNEXURE  I  NORMS FOR OPENING OF NEW POST OFFICES  1. Norms for opening of Branch Post Offices (BOs): 1.1 Population: (a) In Normal Areas: 3000 population in the group of villages to be served by the proposed post office (including 1000 population in the proposed post office village).(b) In Hill, Tribal, Desert and Inaccessible Areas: 500 population in the individual village and 1000 population in the group of villages. 1.2 Distance: (a) In Normal Areas: The minimum distance from the nearest existing post office should be 3 Kms.(b) In Hill, Tribal, Desert and Inaccessible Areas: The distance limit will be the same as above. However, in Hill Areas, the minimum distance limit can be relaxed by the Postal Directorate in cases where such relaxation is warranted by special circumstances which should be clearly explained while submitting a proposal. 1.3 Anticipated Income: (a) In Normal Areas: The minimum anticipated revenue will be 33.33 % of the cost.(b) In Hill, Tribal, Desert and Inaccessible Areas: The minimum anticipated income will be 15% of the cost. It is further to be ensured that as a result of opening of a new BO, the loss in respect of the parent post office does not increase beyond the permissible limit nor does its income reduce below the minimum prescribed. 2. Norms for upgrading/ opening of Departmental Sub Offices (SOs): (a) In Rural Areas: The minimum work load of the Branch Post Office proposed to be upgraded, should be five hours per day. The permissible limit of annual loss is Rs.2400/- in normal rural areas and Rs.4800/- in hill and tribal areas. It is further to be ensured that as a result of opening of a new post office, the loss in respect of the parent post office does not increase beyond the permissible limit nor does its income reduce below the minimum prescribed.(b) In Urban Areas: In urban areas, the post office should initially be self-supporting and at the time of the first annual review, it should show a 5% profit to be eligible for further retention. The minimum distance between two post offices should be 1.5 Km.in cities with a population of 20 lakhs and above and 2 Km.in other urban areas. No two delivery offices, however, should be closer than 5 Kms.from each other. Delivery Post Office in urban areas should have a minimum of 7 Postmens beats. 3. Norms for opening of Head Post Offices Head Post Offices (HOs) are district level offices and the need/ justification for new HOs arises only occasionally. An HO is opened by conversion of a sub-post office into head post office or by bifurcation of an existing HO. The norms prescribed are: (i) Each district should have a head post office provided a minimum of 20 sub-post offices can be attached to it. In the case of backward areas or places where there will be a definite improvement in financing sub-post offices/ GDS post offices, lower standard may be adopted, subject to the approval of the Postal Directorate.(ii) If there is no HO in a district, opening of HO can be considered, if at least 20 SOs in the same district can be attached with advantage, to the proposed HO irrespective of the fact whether parent HO has 60 SOs or not. It has, however, to be ensured that such upgradation does not bring the number of SOs in account with residuary HO below 20.(iii) An existing HO should be bifurcated, if the number of sub-offices attached to it exceeds 60. It should however, be ensured that as a result of the change neither the new nor old HO has less than 20 sub-offices attached to it.

Details of losses suffered by Airports Authority of India (AAI) in respect of non-operational airports belonging to AAI during 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12 are at Annexure-I.(c) & (d) : Development of airports is a continuous process subject to their viability for commercial operations. Further as there are several constraints including non-availability of adequate land for expansion of runways no specific time lines can be given to operationalise these airports. Some of these non-operational airports are not viable for development and scheduled airline operators have not shown interest to operate regular flights as these airports are not commercially viable and have no adequate traffic demands. However, following steps have been taken to encourage operation of flights to some of the low density/ non-operational airports:  (i) No landing charges levied on aircraft with maximum certified capacity of below 80 seats being operated by domestic scheduled airlines and helicopters of all types for operation at AAI airports except at Chennai and Kolkata airports.(ii) Landing and parking charges at all airports in the North-East Region, Jammu & Kashmir, Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep (other than Defence airports) reduced by 25% of the current rates for domestic scheduled airlines.(iii) Night parking charges between 2200 hours and 0600 hours kept at 50% of the existing parking charges at all AAI airports except at Chennai and Kolkata airports; (iv) Waiver of night parking charges for aircraft of domestic operators at airports located in States where the State Government levies VAT on ATF at 5% or below.and ; (v) If an existing airline plans a new flight to connect new stations at airports located in Tier-II and Tier-III cities from Tier-I city and vice-versa or in between two or more Tier-II and Tier-III cities, then the same is given priority over other airlines for allocation of slots as per the slot allocation guidelines.

DELHI
I am back to my pilgrimage of the Punjab and have thus the
opportunity of renewing my Punjab Letters for readers of Navajivan.
I shall first say something about my stay in Delhi and a few
other places before I came back here.

I had hoped to go to Bombay and, having met friends, inspected
the work of the Swadeshi Sabha and Satyagraha Sabha and met the
men and women engaged in spinning, to proceed to Prayag and
thence to Lahore.

But either God or the Khilafat Committee had planned
otherwise. Haji-ul-Mulk Hakimji Ajmal Khan wired to me requesting
me to join the Khilafat deputation which was to wait on the Viceroy.
Reports of this deputation have already appeared in the papers. I shall,
therefore, write nothing about it. The inclusion of Hindus in the
deputation has created an excellent impression. I could see how the
Ali Brothers had been able to win the affection of their community.
Their sweet speech, their constant readiness for work, their loving
nature and sympathy for all, their religious zeal»who would not be
charmed by such qualities! Their very presence fill our Muslim
brethren with happiness. They are, as it were, the eyes of the Muslims
and now, by their love, they are winning over the Hindus as well.

KANPUR
From Delhi I had in any case to go to Prayag. When I returned
from there after meeting Pandit Motilal Nehru, I was pressed to go to
Kanpur. The citizens of Kanpur urged me to go there for a few hours
and open the Swadeshi Bhandar, saying I could leave by the next
train. I could not refuse them.

Kanpur is between Prayag and Delhi and is four hours from
Prayag by Mail. It is a centre of commerce and mills, like Bombay.
The climate too is excellent. This was the first venture here by way of
a swadeshi store, Hasrat Mohani’s being the chief hand behind it.
Thousands attended the opening ceremony and the people’s
enthusiasm was boundless.

A PAINFUL INCIDENT
The Ali Brothers had preceded me and a huge procession was
organized for them. The horse drawing their carriage shied and
started kicking. The crowd was thick. A young and sturdy Muslim
named Abdul Hafeez was standing close by. Recently he had been
devoting himself entirely to public service. He was hit in the chest and
collapsed. In a second this youth, who had looked as if he could never
die, passed away. The two brothers came down from the carriage on
the instant, asked for a cot to be brought and laid the body on it. They
both bore it on their shoulders and went with the procession for some
distance. Others then took their places and they went away to their
work. The procession which had started as a celebration now
accompanied a bier. The day was darkened.

I arrived within about four hours of this occurrence and the
news was given to me at the station. I made a request that the
procession organized for me be cancelled and that I be taken direct to
the Bhandar and, after the opening ceremony was gone through, to
see the body of Abdul Hafeez; the leaders agreed. Having opened the
Bhandar some of us proceeded to pay our homage to the body of our
brother who had passed away. The sight of the dead body of Abdul
Hafeez was heart-rending. I was overwhelmed with grief as I looked
upon that sturdy frame and that charming face, but I took heart from
the fortitude of the Muslim brethren standing around. I observed no
wailing and weeping near the body. The people were exchanging
remarks, unmoved with fear, as though standing round someone in
deep sleep, and described to me how he had been killed. The scene
appealed to me greatly. I thought of the wailing and crying usual
among the Hindus. I wished that we were delivered from that horror. I
also told myself that we could do a great many things if we discarded
this fear of death. I have often felt that the followers of Hinduism, who
should least fear death, fear it most. The very thought of this makes
me feel ashamed. We learn right from our childhood that the soul is
immortal and the body transitory, and that every act will have its
consequence. Why then do we fear death? The only son of Abdul
Hafeez was standing by my side. He too spoke as if untouched by
fear. May God give peace to the soul of Abdul Hafeez.

VISIT TO MEERUT
I left Kanpur by the evening train and reached Merrut the
following morning, i.e., on the 22nd. Meerut is on the G.I.P. line on
the way to Lahore. I had promised to stop there for a few hours. The
citizens had made elaborate preparations. There was almost a
competition between the Hindus and the Muslims in showering
affection on me. The Ali Brothers had been there only recently and
had stayed in the house of a Hindu. I was to stay at the house of a
well-known Muslim barrister of Meerut, Bhai Ismail Khan. Seven
hundred and fifty volunteers were active in the reception, many of
them being from aristocratic families. A mounted cadet corps also
stood at attention. Flag-Poles had been erected along a three-mile
route and ropes tied connecting them. The procession moved along
inside the rope-fence and the crowds stood outside. It included a
band, camel-drawn carriages, men on horseback, people in fancy
dress, etc. The procession, I imagine must have been a mile long.
Thousands had come in from neighbouring villages. Yet the
arrangements were excellent. Addresses were presented to me by the
Municipality, the Khilafat Committee, the general public, Hindu and
Muslim women. There was a separating meeting for women. They
were overflowing with joyous enthusiasm. About a thousand women
were present. I was almost terrified. how could I support so much
affection? I offered it up then and there to Lord Krishna.

My sincere efforts in the cause of the Khilafat have commended
themselves to our Muslim brethren. As long as they base their case on
justice and fight non-violently, I shall be ready to lay down my life
for them. If they put forward unreasonable demands, I will offer
satyagraha even against them. This statement of mine has appealed to
them and they have taken strength from it. All, Hindus and Muslims,
have welcomed the emphasis on truth, whether they themselves abide
by it or not. They are therefore showering affection on me. If the time
comes for me to offer satyagraha against them, they may be angry
with me, too. Those who love us have also the right to be angry with
us.
MUZAFFARNAGAR
From Meerut, I was taken the same night to Muzaffarnagar.
There had been some minor differences between Hindus and Muslims
in this place and I had been dragged there to settle them. The car
reached there at 9 p.m. The crowds were all enthusiasm. No one was
in a mood to take instructions from anyone else. Men on horseback
were present but there was no order as in Meerut. The people
surrounded the car. I was taken through it with great difficulty and
put into a carriage. I had no longer the strength to bear their joyous
tumult. Literally, I had stuffed my ears with cotton wool. Somebody’s
foot was hurt. I was reminded of Abdul Hafeez and took the injured
man into the carriage. I bagged the people to move away. But who
would listen and to whom? I then brought out my usual weapon. I
announced that, if the carriage started before the crowds had moved
aside, I would jump out to the ground, for I could not tolerate anyone
being injured. This miraculous weapon had an electric effect. The
people became quiet and, a little firghtened, moved away, whereupon I
asked [the driver] to be quick and start the carriage. The control was
with me now. All this took a lot of time. The roads were illuminated as
on the festival of lights and a good deal of time was spent in passing
through them. The meeting was yet to take place. The time for the
departure of my train was fast approaching and it was imperative that I
reach Lahore the following day. But the people had realized that they
should no longer make noise nor press round me. We reached the
pandal at 11 p.m. There, at the meeting, everything was in wonderful
order, without anyone’s efforts. Those present must have been 4,000
or more. My voice was slightly hoarse but the audience maintained
such silence that I could be heard even by those sitting farthest from
me. I said a few words on how, if we were to work among lakhs of
people, it was necessary to maintain order. I then referred to the local
dispute and, having advised them to show a spirit of accommodation
and resolve their differences, I took leave from them. Having thus
rushed through these two towns, I reached Lahore on the morning of
the 23rd.

A MIRACLE
Where earlier I had seen a woman, separated from her husband
and living all alone, the image of a lioness, I saw today a happy
couple. Pandit Rambhuj Dutt Choudhri was long since out of jail. I
saw a new glow on Smt. Sarladevi’s face. The face which had been
lined with care was today bright with joy. Or perhaps I am doing her
an injustice. Even during separation Sarladevi had not lost the light on
her face. However, I could see a difference between that light and this;
let us say, rather, that I imagined such a difference. It is certain that
the sadness I used to feel when I stayed before at Sarladevi’s house
has entirely disappeared now, thanks to the return of Choudhriji.

KHILAFAT DISCUSSED
Immediately on arrival I was to engage myself in consultations.
It had been decided to have a meeting with the Ali Brothers and other
prominent Muslim friends in Lahore on the 23rd. They had also,
therefore, arrived by some other trains and the entire day was
occupied in preparing a draft of their demands. Sarladevi’s house has
become a veritable dharmsala. This lady proffered her hospitality to
these distinguished Muslim friends as if she were their sister. The day
passed in preparing the draft and in accepting the hospitality. Night
fell and the time came for the Ali Brothers to depart. “When you
offer satyagraha, invite me to join you; at other times, I am not with
you.” Listening to these words and accepting this as the agreement
between us, the Brothers and Hastrat Mohani Saheb made their
departure. The three have but one thought day and night-how to
secure justice on the Khilafat issue. The Brothers do not put
unqualified faith in satyagraha. Hasrat Mohani Saheb, however,
whispered to me in passing, “I cannot say whether satyagraha can
always be a practicable proposition but, for this purpose and in these
times, I too believe that there is no other weapon like it. I shall
therefore certainly propagate it.”
The Ali Brothers embraced Hastrat Mohani, introducing him as
“our mad Mullah”1. This man does not want honour nor does he
mind insults. He remains engrossed in his work, indifferent to heat
and cold and making no difference between day and night. These are
three jewels of the Muslim community and I feel that Hasrat Mohani
is the brightest of the three. There are not many even among Hindus
who could rival him in his single-minded devotion it is doubtful if
there is any. And just as they are true Muslims, they are true Indians.
The fate of the Khilafat case and the future peace of India depend

"i653089","t20160810494181"," FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS & SPORTS (SHRI VIJAY GOEL) (a) Yes Madam. While presenting the Union Budget for the year 2014-15, the Finance Minister announced that an annual sports event will be started to promote the unique sports traditions of the Himalayan Region and countries such as Nepal and Bhutan will also be invited to participate in addition to the Indian States such as Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and North Eastern States. To implement this announcement, a scheme, namely, Himalayan Region Sports Festival (HRSF) has been framed after obtaining necessary inputs from all Indian Himalayan States, Bhutan and Nepal. First HRSF was allotted to Government of Assam, which was scheduled to be held in February, 2016, but could not be organized owing to 12th South Asia Games being held during February, 2016 at Guwahati. Fresh dates for holding the event are being finalized in consultation with Government of Assam. When the dates are finalized, formal invitation will be sent to the neighbouring countries such as Bhutan and Nepal.(b) Since only a few sports disciplines are common to all States and the Countries in the Himalayan region being invited to participate in the event, competition will he held among the participating teams in common disciplines, viz., Archery, Judo, Athletics, Taekwondo, Boxing, Wrestling, Football and Fencing. However, demonstration / exhibition of games in the Himalayan States / Country will he held to highlight the sporting traditions of the region. Details of indigenous Games and martial arts identified in Himalayan States are attached as Annexure-I.(c) Rs. 1.27 crore was released to Government of Assam in the year 2014-15 for taking up preparatory activities.(d) Sports is a State subject and, therefore, it is primarily the responsibility of the State Government to create adequate sports infrastructure including playgrounds starting from village level. The Central Government complements/supplements the efforts of the State Governments. Hence, Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports does not maintain any record regarding the details of sports infrastructure available in the country, including the Himalayan region.","minister","ls16","2016","201608","20160810","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2016","219220","315402","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","independentcharge","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2016","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2016","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2016","l16_nt_2016","bjp_qna_2016","bjp_nt_2016","other","n201608","l16_qna_201608","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","YouthAffairsandSports","awhethertheGovernmenthasanyactionplantoorganiseannualsportsmeetinHimalayanregiontopromoteuniquesportstraditionsofHimalayanStatesandneighbouringcountriesandifsothedetailsthereofbwhethertheGovernmenthasidentifiedsportstraditionsoftheseStatesinordertoorganisesportsmeetandifsothedetailsthereofcthefundsspentsofarifanybytheGovernmenttoidentifyuniqueHimalayansportstraditionsanddthedetailsofsportsinfrastructureavailableinHimalayanregionasofnow","newdelhi",339

"i57655","t20130109818499","I am very happy to be here with you to unveil the National Electric
Mobility Mission Plan 2020. This is a very important milestone in our
country's efforts for a cleaner and greener transport system for the
future. I compliment all those who have been involved in this massive
collaborative effort to prepare this Plan.

The transport sector today accounts for nearly 30 percent of the
world–wide consumption of energy. Out of this, three fourths comes from
road vehicles. Further, oil provides 95 percent of the primary energy
consumed in the transport sector worldwide. The International Energy
Agency projects that 75 percent of the projected future increases in oil
demand will be from the transport sector. India and China are likely to
account for a major part of this increased global demand for oil.

As we all know, today over 80 percent of India's requirements of
petroleum products is being imported. This dependence on imports is
likely to increase. High international prices of oil contribute
significantly to India's import bills, to our trade deficit, and also
if I may say so in the world of rising energy prices, to inflation, thus
putting a big strain on our economy.

It is, therefore, very important that we make all possible efforts to
reduce the transport sector's dependence on oil. One of the ways in
which this can be achieved is by faster adoption of the full range of
electric vehicle technologies, including hybrid vehicles. These
technologies are not only more efficient but they are also cleaner. They
have the potential of contributing substantially to our efforts for
mitigating the adverse impact of economic development on the environment.
Electric and hybrid vehicles therefore, have a significantly lower level
of emissions, including carbon–di–oxide emissions, which is one of the
major contributors to global warming and to processes of climate change.

I am happy that the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020 has
focused strongly on building domestic capabilities through RandD and a
strong local supply chain for the new technologies. I would urge the
automotive industry to make all possible efforts to develop capabilities
in the area of electric mobility.

At present, significant barriers exist for faster adoption of the new
electric mobility technologies by consumers. It is, therefore, necessary
to create an eco–system whereby these technologies can be nurtured. The
Government is committed to work with industry and other stakeholders to
make it happen.

While promoting private transport through electric vehicles is a positive
step forward, we must give far greater focus to the development of public
transport using energy efficient and alternative energy technologies. I
would urge that this aspect should be kept in view when the individual
components of this plan undergo the due process of approvals in our
system. Given our population size and urban densities, public transport
should be given greater priority than private transport. In our country,
the primary mode of daily commuting should be a high quality energy
efficient public transport system.

As we embark today on this new exciting journey for the Indian automotive
industry, I would also like to make a reference to the Automotive Mission
Plan (AMP) 2006–16, the shared roadmap and vision for the Indian automotive
industry, which we launched some seven years ago. As Praful has mentioned
we have made significant progress in achieving the road maps which we
laid out in that automotive Plan. I am happy that we are well on track to
achieve the various important milestones that we had together set for
ourselves in this Mission Plan. This gives me the confidence to believe
that the automotive industry, which has been at the forefront of Indian
manufacturing, will be able to fully realise the potential that exists in
our country for the new technologies to flourish.

I would like to once again express my appreciation for the good work done
by the National Council and National Board for Electric Mobility and the
efforts that has been made jointly by the Department of Heavy Industry
under the leadership of my distinguished colleague Shri Praful Patel and
the automotive fraternity in developing the National Electric Mobility
Mission Plan 2020. I wish you all success in this noble endeavour that
you are engaged in.

"i680622","t20180404082858","  (a) to (c) With a view to provide more accommodation to travelling passengers, Indian Railways, subject to operational feasibility, commercial viability and availability of resources, augments the load of existing services, which is an on-going process. Indian Railways, as a matter of policy, have already decided that all the Mail/Express trains (except fully reserved trains like Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto, etc.) introduced after 2007-08, shall have at least 6 general class coaches in their standard composition as per feasibility. Besides, to cater to the travelling needs of General Class passengers, Indian Railways operates fully unreserved services like Jan Sadharan, Janseva, Jan Nayak Express and also operates Passenger trains and Intercity services for short distance travel. With this end in view, Indian Railways in the Railway Budget 2016-17, has announced to introduce the Antyodaya Express, a long-distance, fully unreserved, superfast train service, and also to add two to four Deen Dayalu coaches in some long distance trains for unreserved travel to enhance the carrying capacity for the unreserved class passengers.4 pairs of Antyodaya trains have already been introduced so far. Accordingly, 507 coaches including 150 General class coaches have been attached on permanent basis during the year 2017-18 up to February 2018, in existing trains. Further, to clear extra rush of passengers during festive season, vacations, religious congregations (like Kumbh, Ardh Kumbh, Sabrimala, Urs, etc.), Melas, etc., Indian Railways to the extent feasible and justified, not only operates special trains but also augments the loads of existing trains to create extra accommodation for travelling passengers. With this end in view, Indian Railways operated 33,775 trips of special trains and utilized 91,958 coach trips, during the year 2017-18 (up to February 2018), which is also an on-going process on Indian Railways.","minister","ls16","2018","201804","20180404","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2018","232593","342935","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrirajengohain","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2018","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2018","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2018","l16_nt_2018","bjp_qna_2018","bjp_nt_2018","other","n201804","l16_qna_201804","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","Railways","awhethertheGovernmenthasnotformulatedanyconcretepolicytodealwiththeproblemofexcessivecrowdintrainsduringthefestiveseasonsbifsothereasonsthereforandctheeffortsmadebytheGovernmenttoreduceovercrowdingintrainsduringthefestiveseasons","newdelhi",300

STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.466 BY SHRI ANANDRAO ADSUL, MP TO BE ANSWERED ON 6TH AUGUST, 2009 REGARDING INDO-OMAN GAS PIPELINE PROJECT  (a) to (c): An Agreement on Principal Terms for supply of 56.6 million standard cubic meter per day (mmscmd) natural gas through pipeline from Oman to India was signed between the Government of Oman and the Government of India in 1994. Pursuant to the above, GAIL and Oman Oil Company jointly carried out feasibility study of the Oman-India Deepwater Gas Pipeline. However, the Project could not move ahead due to, inter alia, the technical feasibility of the Project not being established and inadequate gas reserves for the Project. In recent years, there have been significant technological advancements in the field of Deep Sea Gas transportation technology. Accordingly, for the last few years, interest has been revived in deep sea gas pipeline route from Middle-East to India. Gas supplies from several gas rich countries of Middle East through Gas Gathering pipeline with Hub in Oman (or its proximity) have been proposed, so as to supply gas to Indian Coast through the said Deep Sea Pipeline.

"i465416","t20031204462612"," (a) to (d): As per the Government decision on dismantling of Administered Pricing Mechanism (APM) in the petroleum sector the Government subsidy on PDS Kerosene and Domestic LPG is on flat rate basis and after accounting for the same the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) could vary the retail selling prices in line with the variations in the international prices of these products. PDS Kerosene and Domestic LPG are domestic fuels of mass consumption. Passing of higher international prices of these products in the domestic selling prices would have hurt the consumers. The matter was therefore re-examined and it was decided in consumer interest that the OMCs will not increase the selling prices of these products during 2003-2004 and the resultant under-recoveries of the OMCs would be absorbed/shared amongst the oil companies. As it is the Government decision to freeze the prices of PDS Kerosene and domestic LPG uptil 31. 3.2004 as such in a deregulated scenario the burden on this account has to be shared/absorbed amongst the Government companies and the private companies are not being asked to share such burden.","minister","ls13","2003","200312","20031204","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2003","24436","127723","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrimatisumitramahajan","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2003","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2003","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2003","l13_nt_2003","bjp_qna_2003","bjp_nt_2003","other","n200312","l13_qna_200312","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","PetroleumandNaturalGas","awhethertheGovernmentareconsideringexclusionofprivatelyownedoilcompaniesfromsubsidingsuppliesofLPGandKerosenemeantforweakersectionsofthesocietybifsothereasonsthereforcwhethertheGovernmentwouldcomeforwardtomakeitmandatoryfortheoilindustryincludingprivatesectortoshareitsburdenofsupportingtheweakersectionsanddifsothedetailsthereof","newdelhi",188

I hope you are still putting on weight, avoiding fever and
making steady progress.

From next month, I am taking charge of Young India and
Navajivan. I feel I may no longer postpone, but I do not think I shall
be able myself to provide all the matter as I practically used to. Please,
therefore, regard yourself as bound to send something every week.
You are specializing in khaddar. Therefore, I do not mind your
articles being always on that subject, but treat it from week to week in
a new way, giving new facts. But, of course, I do not want you to be
tied down to that alone and you may write on any other subject which
you think will be of interest to the readers. I thought that I would be
able by this time to write down my views on Council-entry and the
Hindu-Muslim problem, but I am sorry I have not been able to do so
as yet. Please do not blame me if you do find these views expressed in
the columns of Young India. I wish you were here during the first
month so that you may see everything previous to its being published,
but we must do the best in the circumstances facing us. After all, it is
not of much moment if I cannot avoid mistakes. I know I have the
courage and wisdom to admit and correct them. There is the other
side no doubt. People may be misled and it may be too late to set
them right. Is not that also a part of the training?

Someone must have told you that Golikere1 is already with me
and his assistance is a great thing. He is to help me for the next three
months at the most. Meanwhile Kristodas and Pearilal2 will try to pick
up enough shorthand writing for my purpose. In any case the
pressure after I go to Sabarmati or after I begin to travel will not be so
great. The bulk of the steady writing I want to finish during convalescence.

"i667841","t20170726352735","  (a) Madam, the Government has undertaken extensive study on variability of monsoon especially in South Asia.(b) Details and findings of the study are;  Monsoon varies on all time scales from daily to seasonal, decadal and centennial. We have good understanding especially on intra seasonal and seasonal variability  The mechanisms driving the Monsoon Intraseasonal variability are understood in great detail, which lead to the successful setting up of an extended range prediction system for all the seasons by Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES). This includes both the summer and winter monsoons up to three weeks, heat wave conditions etc. A dynamical Seasonal prediction system for seasonal monsoon prediction is set up through monsoon mission mode initiative by MoES. The teleconnection between El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and monsoon and its time varying relationships are established. As a result most of the current seasonal prediction models are currently able to capture these teleconnections. Subseasonal variability of monsoon and its relationship with ENSO and Indian Ocean established. Changing mean state of Indian Ocean and its role on possible weakening of ENSO monsoon teleconnections is understood in great detail. The relationship between South-East Asia rainfall variability with Indian rainfall variability is established.(c) Does not arise.","minister","ls16","2017","201707","20170726","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2017","229958","330154","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shriyschowdary","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2017","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2017","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2017","l16_nt_2017","bjp_qna_2017","bjp_nt_2017","other","n201707","l16_qna_201707","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","EarthSciences","awhethertheGovernmenthasundertakenanystudyregardingthevariabilityofmonsooninSouthandSouthEastAsiabifsothedetailsandfindingsthereofandcifnotwhethersuchastudyislikelytobeundertakenwithaviewtofindthecausesandeffectsofsuchvariabilityincomingyearsanditspossibleimpactonsocioeconomicalconditionsofIndianpeople","newdelhi",205

Following the Fukushima incident, only three countries, Germany, Switzerland and Taiwan have announced plans to gradually phase out nuclear power on a long term perspective. Most countries with nuclear power programmes have continued with their programmes.(b) In the immediate aftermath of Fukushima, Germany had announced phasing out of nuclear power by 2022. Switzerland had announced that it would not construct new units and Taiwan had announced a decision not to extend the life of the existing units. However, largely the countries with nuclear power have continued with their nuclear power programmes. Since the Fukushima incident in March 2011, 19 new reactors have been connected to the grid in various countries viz. China (11), India (1), Russia (2), Iran (1), Korea (2), Pakistan(1) and Argentina (1). Construction of 24 new units have been started post Fukushima in various countries viz. China (7), India (2), Russia (1), Belarus (2), Pakistan (2), Korea (2), Argentina(1), Unites Arab Emirates (3) and the Unites States of America (4). In the USA, where there had been no new builds for about two decades, construction on four units (Vogtle 3&4 and Summer 2&3) was started. New entrants like the United Arab Emirates have also started construction of nuclear power plants and several other like Bangladesh have plans to start construction of nuclear power plants. There are presently 69 nuclear power reactors with an aggregate capacity of 66125 MW under various stages of construction in the world.","minister","ls16","2015","201502","20150225","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2015","284796","288355","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","DrJITENDRASINGH","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2015","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2015","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2015","l16_nt_2015","bjp_qna_2015","bjp_nt_2015","other","n201502","l16_qna_201502","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","AtomicEnergy","awhetheraftertheconsequencesofdisastrousincidentswhichoccurredinatomicenergyprojectsatFukushimainJapanmanycountrieshavedecidedtoclosedownorhasdiscouragedtheconstructionoftheiratomicenergyprojectsandbifsothedetailsthereofalongwithnamesofsuchcountries","newdelhi",248

 Babu Ram Narayan Singh : (a) Will the Honourable the Labour Member please state the circumstances which led to the issue of the Labour Department Circular Memo No. M.S. 21, dated the 14th November, 1944, prohibiting the award of works to contractors whose relation are working in officers, etc., under the Central Public Works Department ?
Is he aware that this circular has caused great discontent and hardship to many highly reputed and old-established contractors ?
Do similar orders exist in any other Department of Government ? If so, will he place a copy of such orders on the table of the House ?
Was Legal Department of the Government of India consulted before the Labour Department issued these orders ? If so, what was their opinion ?
Cannot the purpose of the orders be served if a relation of a contractor who happens to work in the same Division is transferred to some other Division or other station ? If not, how ?
Will he please consider the advisability of cancelling these orders ? If not, what are the reasons ?

I have your letter. I had to keep you without a letter for one day.
Pyarelal may or may not be there, and so I am writing to you.
Just as you have been giving good news about the patients there, I
can do the same about the patients here. Both are well. Nirmal Singh’s
ganglion has all but subsided. His fever has come down today. He has
not been given anything except lime and soda and since yesterday
glucose. He asked for tamarind water which I gave.

I have your letter.  Kamble has been proved to be a liar.  Where
he is, nobody knows.
Boiled   milk   is   certainly   better.   Add   some   potassium
permanganate in water.  It is, no doubt, against nature.  The same is
true of quinine also.   But when we are helpless, we have to violate
nature.
I have already written about natural diet.  Milk, fruit, leafy
vegetables, potatoes, etc., are included in it.
It is good to throw some lime into the well.  You may also throw
some bleaching powder.  If pure water is available, then there is no
need of disinfectants.
It irks me that the grinding stone cannot be stopped even for
two minutes for the sake of silence.  Two minutes is nothing.  Just the
same, Babaji1  may do what he thinks right.
You have explained well what you meant when you talked about
being a great sinner.
I  would not consider eggs and fish as opposed to natural diet.
They cannot be included in a vegetarian diet, but then neither can
milk.

"i646079","t20160426965967"," (a) In 2007, the Ministry had requested National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) to conduct a nationwide survey on extent, pattern and trend of alcohol and drug abuse. Accordingly, the NSSO had conducted a pilot survey in the cities of Amritsar, Imphal and Mumbai in March-April 2010. The report of the pilot survey was received from NSSO on 05. 01.2011. On examination of the report of the Pilot Survey, certain issues relating to under estimation, non-coverage of certain age groups etc.were raised and a more comprehensive and extended pilot survey was suggested. The National Statistical Commission (NSC) in its meeting held on 06. 09.2013 has observed that no purpose would be served by conducting the proposed Advanced Pilot Survey and suggested that the methodology and the sampling design may be looked afresh. Thereafter, a Working Group was constituted by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, with NSSO as nodal organization to devise the modalities of advanced pilot survey in the States of Punjab and Manipur. The report of the Working Group has been received. However, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has informed that the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment can conduct the survey through the help of NGOs on the pattern of earlier pilot survey done in the year 2010. The NSSO would provide all the necessary support if required. The Ministry is in the process of finalizing an agency for conducting the National Survey.(b) State-wise details of Grant in aid released to the NGOs and number of beneficiaries under the Scheme of Assistance for Prevention of Alcoholism and Substance (Drugs) Abuse during last three years, including Rajasthan, is placed at Annexure.(c) As per scheme parameters, funds have not been a constraint.(d)Under the Scheme of Assistance for Prevention of Alcoholism and Substance (Drugs) Abuse and for Social Defence Services, the Ministry designates an NGO of repute with adequate experience and consistently good track record as a Regional Resource and Training Centre (RRTC) on receipt of recommendation from the State Government. Presently, twelve NGOs have been designated as RRTCs under the Scheme.(e) The proposed National Survey as stated in para (a) above, would capture the data regarding extent, pattern and trend of drug abuse in the country.","minister","ls16","2016","201604","20160426","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2016","256976","308392","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrivijaysampla","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2016","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2016","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2016","l16_nt_2016","bjp_qna_2016","bjp_nt_2016","other","n201604","l16_qna_201604","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","SocialJusticeandEmpowerment","awhethertheGovernmentproposestoundertakeanewnationwidesurveyondrugabuseandifsothedetailsthereofbthedetailsoffundsallocatedtovariousNGOsVoluntaryOrganisationsforrehabilitationofvictimsofsubstanceabuseandalcoholismalongwiththenumberofpersonsbenefitedduringeachofthelasttwoyearsandthecurrentyearStatewiseincludingRajasthancwhetherthereisshortageoffundsforthesaidpurposeifsothedetailsthereofandthestepstakenbytheGovernmenttoimprovethefundingforthepurposedwhethertheGovernmenthasanyproposaltoincreasethenumberofRegionalResourceTrainingCentresfunctioninginthecountryifsothedetailsthereofandthestepstakeninthisregardandethemeasuresstepstakenbytheGovernmenttounderstandthefrequentchangesinpatternofdrugabuseduringthelastfiveyearsinordertodealwiththemenace","newdelhi",381

"i13378","t19280412425063","MY DEAR MOTILALJI,

I have your letter. I did not write without full knowledge of what
was being done on behalf of mill-owners. They are starting a separate
organization which will have nothing to do with us. However I am
quite at one with you what we should leave no stone unturned to
secure their full co-operation. I am doing all I can at this end and you
will let me know what success you have with Sir Purushottamdas. But I
would like you to study the possibilites of the charkha movement. It is
not so hopeless as you seem to think. Let me put the position in a
nutshell. Mills by themselves cannot achieve the boycott within the
time that will satisfy the politician buy mills if they play the game
together with charkha can do so within a time that will satisfy the most
sanguine expectations of any patriot. The charkha by itself can
achieve the boycott within a reasonable period, the pace being
dependent upon intensity of the work put in by the politicians. And as
a khadi manufacturer, I am open to negotiate with anyone for
supplying almost an illimitable quantity provided he does not bind me
to the quality beyond a certain limit and does not mind the cost.

I send you a copy of the report of the Spinners’ Association1
and a little pamphlet which latter you can read in 5 minutes but which
gives you some very telling figures. The only thing that hampers the
progress of khadi is the want of demand and want of capital.

I am yet awaiting the expected reply from Romain Rolland. If
he does not cable, I may get a letter from him next week.

Yours sincerely,

No Consumer Club has been set up in Uttar Pradesh.(b): Setting up of a network of Consumer Clubs in the schools is considered to be a good exercise for spreading awareness about the rights of the consumers. Non formal pro-active system of imparting consumer education to the school children by involving them in various consumer welfare and consumer protection activities by setting up of consumer clubs will go a long way in educating the children about the rights of consumers as provided in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The Indian Institute of Public Administration had conducted an evaluation of the Scheme for setting up Consumer Clubs. The evaluation report, inter alia, indicates that the Scheme on Consumer Clubs is in good progress as it involves the youth, particularly students of schools in strengthening the consumer movement and creation of awareness. The report has also made suggestions to continue the scheme by making appropriate modifications in the scheme.","minister","ls15","2010","201011","20101116","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2010","150717","222700","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","profkvthomas","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2010","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2010","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2010","l15_nt_2010","inc_qna_2010","inc_nt_2010","other","n201011","l15_qna_201011","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","ConsumerAffairsFoodandPublicDistribution","athenumberofconsumerclubssetupinthecountryincludingUttarPradeshStatewiseandbtheextenttowhichtheseclubshavebeeneffectiveinachievingtheirobjectives","newdelhi",176

"i428886","t20010831564991"," (a): Public Distribution System(PDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and State Governments. While the Central Government is responsible for procurement storage and transportation of the PDS commodities upto the designated depots and making them available to the States the responsibility of distribution of the essential commodities to the consumers through the Fair Price shops and administration of the PDS rests with the State Governments and UT Administrations. As multiple agencies including a large network of Fair Price Shops (FPSs) are involved in PDS operations the possibility of shortcomings in the implementation of the PDS in some flood affected areas of Orissa cannot be ruled out.(b) (c)&(d): State Governments including the Government of Orissa have been requested to closely monitor the Public Distribution System at the Fair Price Shop (FPS) and other levels. In order to efficiently reach the essential commodities under Public Distribution System to the consumers in a transparent and accountable manner a Model Citizens` Charter for Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) has been drawn up and circulated to States/UTs for adoption. Based on the belief that truly democratic institutions do better safeguard food security concerns of all than the State bureaucracy the Government has also advised the State Governments to more substantially involve the Gram Panchayats in supervision and monitoring of PDS especially at FPS level as a measure of social audit. With a view to protect the interest of the producers and consumers Consultative Committee at Zonal and State level have been formed in the Food Corporation of India (FCI) which serve as an interface between the FCI and the PDS in the States. The Committees discuss and make recommendations on procurement distribution and transportation of foodgrains sale disposal of foodgrains and implementation of `Antyodaya Anna Yojana`.","minister","ls13","2001","200108","20010831","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2001","41013","91191","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrisriramchauhan","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2001","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2001","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2001","l13_nt_2001","bjp_qna_2001","bjp_nt_2001","other","n200108","l13_qna_200108","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","ConsumerAffairsFoodandPublicDistribution","awhethertherearecomplaintsthatthePDSdoesnotfunctioneffectivelyinthefloodaffectedareasofthecountryparticularlyinOrissabifsowhethertheUnionGovernmenthaveaproposaltostreamlinePublicDistributionSysteminthoseareasandelsewhereinthecountrycifsothedetailsthereofanddthestepstakentoimplementsuchschemeinthecountryparticularlyinOrissa","newdelhi",299

This report makes rough estimates of the total magnitude of economic cost associated with environmental degradation in India. The World Bank has also estimated that about 40 000 deaths in 36 cities have occurred in 1995 due to air pollution. However there is no conclusive data available to confirm these figures. The Government have taken various steps to control pollution which includes the following: - (i) Effluent and emission standards have been notified under the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 to check air water and noise pollution.(ii) Industries have been directed to install necessary pollution control equipments in a time bound basis and legal action is taken against the defaulting units.(iii) A number of Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) have been installed in the industrial estates of Maharashtra Gujarat Tamil Nadu Andhra Pradesh Karanataka Uttar Pradesh Rajasthan etc.(iv) For control of pollution from vehicles emission norms for both petrol and diesel driven vehicles at the manufacturing stage were introduced for the first time in 1990 and made tighter in 1996. More stringent emission norms have come into effect from 1. 4.2000.(v) CNG is supplied for automobiles through a number of retail outlets in Delhi and Mumbai to cater to the CNG fitted vehicles.(vi) A notification on Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000 has been issued on 14. 02.2000 to check noise pollution from all sources.(vii) An Environmental Action Plan to control pollution in Mumbai Metropolitan Region has been prepared and is forwarded to the Government of Maharashtra for implementation.(viii) Owing to the different measure taken to control vehicular pollution in Delhi the level of pollutants in the recent years have shown a decreasing trend.(ix) Environmental Epidemiological studies have been undertaken to find out the extent of health implications due to environmental pollution.","minister","ls13","2001","200102","20010226","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2001","34415","78699","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shritrbaalu","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2001","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2001","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2001","l13_nt_2001","bjp_qna_2001","bjp_nt_2001","other","n200102","l13_qna_200102","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","EnvironmentandForests","awhetheraccordingtoareportbytheWorldBankpropertyworthonecroredollarisdamagedand20lakhpeopledieeveryyearinthecountryduetopollutionandbifsothereactionoftheGovernmenttheretoandthedetailsofthestepstakenbytheGovernmentinthisregard","newdelhi",328

"i25519","t19340824063790","CHI. MARY,
I was glad to hear from you so soon in reply to my postcard1.
Jamnalalji is doing  exceedingly  well. The  operation  itself  was a
prolonged affair because it had to do with the bony parts of the ear
and there were some tough bones to be chiselled and  hammered. But
the convalescence has been exceptionally easy. He was allowed to
walk yesterday and is almost on normal diet. Even the stitches were
taken off. That of course does not mean that the bones where cuts
were made were healed. That must take some time, but not so much as
the doctors had expected. They say that the operation was successful
and very cleverly done.
Mira had a sudden call from within. One fine morning she came
to me  and said that she felt an irresistible call to go to England. I
asked her, “when”; and  she said, “as soon as I can  pack and go”. I
did not resist her. On the contrary I encouraged  her because I felt
that  it must do her good and be a  rich experience, though she might
be able to do nothing. I have confidence that she will not make any
serious blunder by talking nonsense. She is too well-balanced to do
that. She does not expect to be away for more than four months, but I
have  written to her  not to hurry back and  that she should stay longer
if it was necessary. Her programme is very  elaborate. She is leaving
practically no friend unvisited and she is booked to go to Scotland
also. She has been sending long letters and she herself is more than
satisfied with the way she is being received. I fancy that she will return
in October. Is it not strange that the English climate is not suiting her
as well as the Indian climate ! She told me that she was freezing in
Wales ! If you want to see a  sample of her very  long but interesting
letters I will gladly send you a specimen.
I hope you are now thoroughly restored. Do you hear from
Love.

Further, Supreme Court has stated that it will be for the Union Government to determine whether and if so what, course should be adopted for this purpose.(c): Agriculture being a State subject, the State Governments undertake development of perspective plans and ensures effective implementation of the programmes/ schemes. Also, Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments through various Schemes/ Programmes. The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare has taken a number of measures for welfare of farmers including agricultural labourers. The Government of India is targeting to double the income of the farmers by the year 2022. To achieve this, the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare has taken a number of measures. The Government aims to reorient the agriculture sector by focusing on an income-centeredness in addition to pure production centeredness approach. With a view to provide better insurance coverage to crops for risk mitigation on account of natural calamities and other factors, the Government has launched a Crop Insurance Scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) from Khariff 2016 season. This scheme provides insurance cover for all the stages of the crop cycle including post-harvest risks in specified instances. Continue.2/-     -2-  Giving a major boost for the farmers income, the Government has approved the increase in the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for all Kharif and Rabi Crops for 2018-19 season at a level of at least 150 percent of the cost of production. In addition, the Government is implementing various schemes, viz. Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme, Neem Coated Urea, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY), National Agriculture Market scheme (e-NAM) and Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA), Interest subvention schemes and Kisan Credit Card Schemes. The Government is also implementing several centrally sponsored Schemes viz.

"i633","t19040225125865","At the meeting of the Municipal Conference of the Transvaal
which sat at johannesburg last week. Mr. George Constable, representing
the Boksburg Council, moved the following resolution:
That in view of the fact that a new Asiatic law is to be brought before
the Legislative Council for its consideration, and that the question is of such
vital importance to local governing bodies, this Conference of Transvaal
Municipalities places on record its opinion that the most satisfactory policy
to the inhabitants will be to place all Asiatics in Bazaars, fair compensation
to be paid to any who may be trading outside under licenses first granted by
the late Government; further, that all local authories be permitted to make
what by-laws may be necessary to regulate matters concernig coloured people
and in regard to the fixing of sites for bazaars, places of residence, etc.

The resolution was carried, Mr. Goch alone dissenting.

The resolution modestly asks that all Asiatics be placed in
Bazaars for trade and residence; that those who traded before the war
under licenses be compensated, and that powers be given to the
Municipalities to regulate these matters. In naked terms, the proposition
means that the British Indians should be starved into leaving the
country. In Mr. Goch’s words “the idea of placing Asiatics in bazaars
is not so much to put them there as to get rid of them altogether.”
The British Indians have shown conclusively that the so-called Bazaars
are totally unfit for habitation or trade. It were a mercy to put the
British Indians out of the country altogether rather than subject them
to vivisection and kill them by inches. Mr. Constable’s ideal of the
powers he would have for the Municipalities is Brandfort in the
Orange River Colony. We had occasion some time ago to deal with the
municipal bye-laws for that township, and we think we shewed how the
Coloured people thereunder become mere chattels.

It is, we fear, useless to appeal to Mr. Constable’s sense of fariness.
He worships the fetish of the law of self-preservation. And he has
no difficulty in getting round his conscience, as so many of us do
when blinded by prejudice or bigotry, and satisfying himself that the
great law demands that the British Indians should be ruined. We have
had other interpretations of the law by Englishmen who were perhaps
more equi-minded and, therefore, better able to judge. They thought
that the law was limited by another and higher, namely, that we should
so preserve ourselves as not to encroach upon other people’s rights.
The simple corollary that Mr. Constable’s countrymen have also laid
down as flowing from the above limitation is that when we have to
deal with people who do not do as we do, and if we are satisfied that
we are in the right, we should act by them so as to raise them to our
level and not to crush them. May we ask him and his friends to consider
this view?

What is, however, the secret of the increasing intensity of the
opposition to the Indian trader? Not that the number hostile to the
Indian interests is increasing, but the gentlemen who first instigated
the oposition are becoming more and more exacting in their demands
for repression of the Asiatic.

Have the Indians given any cause? The answer is undoubtedly in
the negative. What is it, then, that has fed the flame of prejudice? The
speakers at the meeting have supplied the answer. They supported the
resolution to aid the Government. Why aid the Government? Is it anti-
Asiatic? Does it, therfore, need the support of the populace in the
policy? We would not go so far as to say that the Government is
deliberately anti-Asiatic. But the gentlemen of the White Leagues, having
found by experience that, if they cry loud enough and persistenty
against the Asiatics, they can practically get what they want, have
naturally grown bolder in their demands. They asked for the
enforcement of the Law of 1885 and the Bazaar Notice was the reply.
they wanted the Asiatics sent to Locations, and Bazaars have been
established in several places. We might quote further instances of
yielding to the white opposition on the part of the powers that be.
Such accommodation on the part of the Government has been rightly
interpreted as an invitation to continue the agitation. Mr Constable’s
motion is the response. Lord Milner having tinkered with the rights of
the Asiatics, our friends at Boksburg, like the baby in the tub, “won’t
be happy till they’ve got it”. Lord Milner has promised to alter the
anti-Asiatic laws so as to bring them in harmony with the British
Constitution. The Muncipal Conference has declared in what way it
wants them altered. It would out-Kruger Mr. Kruger. The erstwhile
Uitlanders complained that they had no voice in the affairs of State
during the old regime. Now that they cried themselves hoarse, they
would make the British Indians, whose co-operation they were glad to
have in fighting the old rergine, Uitlanders under the common flag.
And this is their view of honour and faith!
In the midst of the whole of the wretchedly painful proceedings
of the Conference, Mr. Goch’s speech was an oasis in the deseert. He
spoke plainly and firmly. He protested against the resolution and
adduced arguments in support of his protest which would convince
anyone not steeped in bias. The Indian community is beholden to
Mr. Goch for his outspokenness and the stand he took up for Justice.
And so long as we have men like him, we shall continue to believe in
the ultimate triumph of a cause which is inherently just.

However the technology level of MIG-21 aircraft is of 1960_s vintage whereas Mirage and Jaguar aircrafts are based on modern technology. MIG-21 aircraft has larger fleet than that of Mirage and Jaguar aircrafts and accordingly their utilisation rate is also higher exposing them to greater probability for accidents. Thus accidents in MIG aircrafts are not due to lack of safety measures for Pilots.(d) Safety measures being the same no specific steps are being taken in this regard. However it has been planned to upgrade a major portion of the fleet with modern technology avionics to aid the pilot.","minister","ls13","2000","200012","20001207","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2000","56047","75075","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrigeorgefernandes","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2000","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2000","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2000","l13_nt_2000","bjp_qna_2000","bjp_nt_2000","other","n200012","l13_qna_200012","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","Defence","awhetherMIG21aircraftisnotequippedwithadequatesafetymeasuresforpilotsasareavailableinMirageandJaguarbifsothereasonsthereforcwhetherlackofadequatesafetymeasuresforpilotsinMIG21aircraftisresultinginrapidincreaseinnumberofaccidentsofthisaircraftanddifsothestepsbeingtakenorproposedtobetakenforprovidingadequatesafetymeasuresforpilotsinMIG21","newdelhi",135

This includes releases during 2016-17 and 2017-18 for which utilisation certificates are not yet due. The main reason for delay in submission of Utilisation Certificates is inability of States for faster absorption of funds due to short working season. The State-wise details of unspent balance lying with the States are as under:-  (Rs.in crore) <pre> State Unspent balance with States (up to 31. 12. 2017) UC due (up to 31. 12. 2017)  Arunachal Pradesh 221.98 40.21 Assam 372.83 108.51 Manipur 242.42 10.95 Meghalaya 182.30 20.47 Mizoram 127.20 40.85 Nagaland 105.27 16.18 Sikkim 85.16 0.00 Tripura 106.85 0.00 Total 1444.01 237.17 </pre> (c) and (d) Government has recently approved a new scheme North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS) at a cost of Rs. 1600.00 crore, for a period of three years from the FY 2017-18 to 2019-20.

A monitoring mechanism for tracking the implementation of the NLCPR scheme is in place. The Ministry has an online e-Portal/Project Management System for submission, surveillance and follow up of NLCPR projects. The portal helps in keeping surveillance on financial, physical and visual progress for timely completion of projects. Further, there is constant review of the progress of utilization of funds with the State Governments at all levels, including visits by the senior officials to the States and the Ministry is in constant touch with the officials concerned of the State Governments through video-conferencing and other IT tools like WhatsApp, SMSes and E-mails. Measures taken also include sanction of token release of only Rs.10 lakh and the remaining release just-in-time after work order is issued apart from review at various levels and extensive use of Information Technology (IT) tools.","minister","ls16","2018","201804","20180404","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2018","263839","342974","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","independentcharge","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2018","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2018","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2018","l16_nt_2018","bjp_qna_2018","bjp_nt_2018","other","n201804","l16_qna_201804","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","DevelopmentOfNorthEasternRegion","awhetheralargeamountoffundsarelyingunspentunderNonLapsableCentralPoolofResourcesNLCPRschemebifsothedetailsthereofandthereasonsthereforStatewisecwhethertheGovernmenthasformulatedanynewpolicyschemetomakefundsavailableforprojectscriticaltothedevelopmentofNorthEasternStatesdifsothedetailsthereofewhethertheGovernmenthasformulatedanymonitoringmechanismfortrackingtheimplementationoftheNLCPRschemeandfifsothestepsbeingtakenbytheGovernmenttowardseffectiveandtimelyimplementationoftheschemes","newdelhi",402

As per Indias commitment to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) under financial services, market access is restricted to 12 branches in a year to all foreign banks taken together. India has been complying with this commitment. However, as per the WTO commitment, licenses for new foreign banks in branch mode presence, may be denied when the maximum share of assets in India both on and off balance sheet of foreign banks branches to total assets both on and off balance sheet of the banking system exceeds 15 percent.(c): During the year 2014, following banks were allowed to open branches/representative office in India:  (i) Korea Exchange Bank was allowed to open its maiden branch in Chennai through upgradation of its representative office in New Delhi.(ii) Industrial Bank of Korea was allowed to open its maiden branch in New Delhi through upgradation of its representative office in New Delhi.(iii) Banco Santander was allowed to open a representative office in Mumbai.(d) & (e): As per Indias commitment to the WTO under financial services, Market access is restricted to 12 branches in a year to all foreign banks taken together. India has been complying with this commitment and in some years gone beyond this commitment as a measure of autonomous liberalization. Foreign banks are granted a universal banking license in India, in terms of which they can carry all banking activities as provided in the relevant statute. Further, in allocating specific centres, the Reserve Bank of India has been following a consistent policy of inclusive banking by foreign banks in India and therefore a mix of banked and under-banked centres is allotted to each foreign bank to expand their presence.","minister","ls16","2015","201503","20150313","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2015","224757","291026","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrijayantsinha","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2015","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2015","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2015","l16_nt_2015","bjp_qna_2015","bjp_nt_2015","other","n201503","l16_qna_201503","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","Finance","awhethertheGovernmentisundercommitmentwiththeWorldTradeOrganisationWTOwithregardtoregulationonissueoflicensesandopeningofbranchesofforeignbanksacrossthecountrybifsothedetailsthereofcthenumberofforeignbanksallowedtobeopenedduringthelastoneyeardwhetherthenumberofbranchesofforeignbankallowedtofunctionincountryishigherthanthatofthecommitmentmadebytheGovernmentinthisregardandeifsothedetailsthereofalongwiththereasonstherefor","newdelhi",286

It requires consultation and approval of various Constitutional Authorities. Initiation of proposal for appointment of Judge in the Supreme Court vests with the Chief Justice of India while initiation of proposal for appointment of Judges in High Courts vests with the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court. While every effort is made to fill up the existing vacancies expeditiously, vacancies of Judges of High Courts do keep on arising on account of retirement, resignation or elevation of Judges and also due to increase in strength of Judges. Under the Constitutional framework, the selection and appointment of Judges in Subordinate Courts is the responsibility of the High Courts and State Governments concerned.(c) to (e): As per information made available by the High Courts and respective State Governments, as on 30. 09.2018 the sanctioned strength of Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts is 22,644. The number of Judicial Officers in position and vacant posts is 17,509 and 5,135 respectively. In September, 2016, the Union Minister of Law & Justice wrote to the Chief Ministers of States and the Chief Justices of High Courts to enhance the cadre strength of the District and Subordinate Courts and provide physical infrastructure to the State judiciary and the same was reiterated in May, 2017. In August, 2018, in the context of increasing pendency of cases, the Union Minister of Law & Justice wrote to all Chief Justices of High Courts to monitor the status of the vacancies regularly and to ensure proper coordination with the State Public Service Commission to fill up vacant posts as per time schedule prescribed by the Honble Supreme Court in the Malik Mazhar Sultan case. In order to facilitate regular filling up of these vacancies in a smooth and time-bound manner, the Department of Justice vide its letter dated 28th April, 2017 suggested creation of a Central Selection Mechanism to the Honble Supreme Court. The Honble Supreme Court suo motu converted the Governments suggestions into a writ petition on 09th May, 2017 and directed all State Governments (including Union Territories) to file their responses and suggestions by way of affidavits. The above matter is subjudice at present. The filling up of vacancies is also being monitored by the Supreme Court in a suo-motu Writ Petition (Civil) no.2 of 2018. A series of meetings were held with Registrars General of all High Courts and Law Secretaries of all State Governments/ UTs through Video Conferencing in January, 2018, July, 2018 and November, 2018 as a follow up to fill up posts of Judicial Officers in District and Subordinate Courts. The Department of Justice has hosted a web-portal on its website for reporting and monitoring of sanctioned and working strength, and vacancies of Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts on monthly basis.

Water Resource and Irrigation Potential

Average annual surface water flow
available in the country is estimated at around
1869 billion cubic metre (bcm).  However,
because of the topographical, hydrological and
other constraints, only about 690 bcm of the
available surface water can be utilised, in
addition to the annual replenishable ground
water resources of 432 bcm.  Thus, the total
utilisable water resource in the country is
assessed at 1122 bcm.  The present utilisation
of water for various purposes such as drinking,
irrigation, industry and energy, etc. is about 750
bcm.  The use of water for irrigation constitutes
about 84 per cent of the water used.  With the
increase in demand of water for other uses,
the share of water use for irrigation is likely to
go down to about 73 per cent by 2025 AD.

The Ultimate Irrigation Potential (UIP)
has been reassessed at 139.89 million
hectare (m.ha). This is based on the re-
assessment of the ground water potential raised
to 64.05 m.ha from 40 m.ha earlier and re-
assessment of potential of surface minor
irrigation from 15 m.ha to 17.38 m.ha Thus,
there has been an increase of 26.39 m.ha in
the UIP of the country, which was 113.5 m.ha
before re-assessment.

Creation of irrigation potential and its
optimum utilization continues to receive high
priority in Government planning.  From 22.6
million hectares of irrigation potential in 1950,
the country’s created irrigation potential is
estimated to have gone up to about 94.7 million
hectares by 1999-2000 comprising 35.3 million
hectares under major and medium projects and
million hectares under minor irrigation
potential.  The capacity and utilization of irrigation
potential is listed in Table 8.16.

With a view to ensuring early completion
of irrigation projects, the Government of India
launched the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit
Programme (AIBP) in 1996-97, under which the
Centre provides additional central assistance
by way of loans to the States for early
completion of selected large irrigation and multi-
purpose projects.  Rs. 4031.98 crore had been
released under AIBP as Central Loan
Assistance (CLA) to the States during 1996 to
2000. CLA of Rs.915.71 crore has been
released by end of November, 2000.  With effect
from 1999-2000 CLA under AIBP is also being
provided for Minor irrigation projects of North-
east region, hill states and drought prone
districts of Orissa.   The revised funding pattern
for general category States is in the ratio of 2:1
Centre: State) whereas that for the Special
Category States of North East Region, hill states
of J&K, HP and Sikkim and for selected districts
of Orissa is in the ratio of 3:1 (Centre: State).
The other steps taken to extend irrigation
benefits to more areas include promotion of
better water management practices, installation
of sprinkler and drip irrigation systems in water
scarce and drought-prone areas, conjunctive
use of surface and ground water and farmers’
participation in irrigation water management.
Under-utilisation of irrigation potential particularly
under major and medium irrigation projects,
continues to persist.  To reduce the gap
between the irrigation potential created and
utilised and, to increase crop productivity under
the command areas, Command Area
Development Programme (CADP) has been
under implementation since 1974-75.  During
1999-2000, Rs. 163.3 crore were released to
States as Central assistance under the
programme.

National water Policy 1987 states that
the water rate should be such that user knows
the scarcity value of water and is motivated for
efficient use of water. It was therefore expected
that the water rate charged should cover annual
maintenance and operation cost and a part of
the fixed cost. However, the water rates have
not been revised by most of the states for the
last two or three decades. A few states revised
water rates during the period 1981-86 but these
new rates were not enforced.

STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUEST: NO.362 FOR 27. 4.2007 REGARDING GROWTH OF POPULATION LIVING IN URBAN SLUMS.(a)&(b): The UN-Habitat Report `The State of the World`s Cities 2006-07: The Millenium Development Goals and Urban Sustainability - 30 years of Shaping the Habitat Agenda` does not provide projections of the urban poor population in 2020 but it makes projections of urban slum population in India to be 219.47 million in 2020. The Government is in agreement with the conclusion in the report that urban poverty and slum development need to be brought to the central stage of the development agenda.`  (c): The reasons for increase in the number of persons living in slums in urban areas in the country, inter-alia, are:  (i) Increase in urbanization due to rural urban migration, natural increase and re-classification of rural areas into urban centres.(ii) Inability of large section of urban society, especially the poor, to access land and housing in cities and towns, due to spiraling land prices and lack of availability of affordable housing;  (iii) Lack of provision of infrastructure and services in settlements inhabited by the poor due to long periods of inadequate investment in such facilities by urban local bodies; and  (iv) Old areas in cities and towns getting further dilapidated due to lack of maintenance and natural ageing coupled with poor quality of services.(d): Considering the need to address the issues of slum development and housing in cities and towns, the Government has launched Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) with effect from December 3, 2005. Under the Basic Services to the Urban Poor (BSUP) programme, development of housing and provision of basic civic amenities to poor households are addressed in 63 Mission cities. The problems of non-Mission cities are addressed through Integrated Housing & Slum Development Programme (IHSDP). The components supported by the Government under JNNURM are:  i. Integrated development of slums, i.e.housing and development of infrastructure projects in the slums in the identified cities.ii. Projects involving development/improvement/ maintenance of basic services to the urban poor.iii. Slum improvement and rehabilitation projects.iv. Projects on water supply/sewerage/drainage, community toilets/ baths, etc.v. Houses at affordable costs for slum dwellers/urban poor/ Economically Weaker Sections/ Lower Income Group categories.vi. Construction and improvements of drains/storm water drains.vii. Environmental improvement of slums and solid waste management.viii. Street lighting.ix. Civic amenities, like, community halls, child care centres, etc.x. Operation and maintenance of assets created under this component.xi. Convergence of health, education and social security schemes for the urban poor.","minister","ls14","2007","200704","20070427","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2007","123982","175989","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","kumariselja","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2007","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2007","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2007","l14_nt_2007","inc_qna_2007","inc_nt_2007","other","n200704","l14_qna_200704","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","HousingandUrbanPovertyAlleviation","awhetherthepopulationofurbanpoorinIndiaislikelytotouch200millionin2020asperUNHabitatreportbifsothedetailsthereofandthereactionoftheGovernmenttheretocthereasonsforincreaseinthepersonslivingintheslumsinurbanareasinthecountryanddthestepstakenandproposedtobetakenbytheGovernmentinthisregard","newdelhi",458
"i67182","t20160505548511","Annette Dixon: Sadhguru, it's a pleasure to
have you here with us today at the World Bank,
 and I know there are many colleagues, who
have followed you closely.
 I have to say, this is a first for me interviewing
a mystic (Sadhguru laughs), and having a
 conversation with a mystic. So I’m here to learn and to
understand more about your philosophy,
 and how your work is helping to achieve a better world.
It's great to see so many colleagues here today.
 In the World Bank of course, our mission it
to help reduce or eliminate poverty in the world
 and to improve the living standards of the people of
the world. And we live in a planet,
 where there is too much to do, and I know your work
is also working to that goal as well.
 I want, today, to start with where we converge,
where we see the world in the same way, and
 as I’ve read and listened to you talking, and thanks to
the internet, I was able to watch you on YouTube.
 You tell us that humanity has the necessary
capability and resources to address
 every problem or almost every problem in the planet,
but the only missing element is our willingness.
 And I think that you work to kindle this willingness
within the millions of people, who follow
 you, and they work to extend their hearts, their heads
and their minds to the betterment of humanity.
 Here, at the World Bank – and I know there
are colleagues here from the IMF (Referring
 to the International Monetary Fund) as well
– we also work to this goal.
 And I think, by definition, because we work
on development, we are all optimists.
 So, I’d like to start by asking how we can
work to make the world a better place.
 You’re in a room full of economists, who
look at poverty through the lens of numbers, statistics.
 I always say, we can only make a decision
if we have a spreadsheet.
 But can you tell us how you define poverty and what
do you mean by raising human consciousness,
 and how this can contribute to ending world poverty?
 Sadhguru: Good morning to everyone (Laughs).
 Participants: Good morning.
 Sadhguru: I think and it's best that we… this much
abused word “consciousness”,
 we better define that in some sense (Laughs).
 See, when we look at our experience of life, when we
look at individual experience,
 everything that human beings experience here
is coming from what they see, what they hear,
 what they smell, taste and touch. 
Or in other words through the five sense organs.
 Five sense organs, in the very nature of things,
can perceive only that which is physical.
 You can see only that which is physical. 
That which is not physical, you cannot see.
 Similarly, to touch, smell, hear, everything has to be
physical. So what is the basis of physicality?
 Physicality means a defined boundary. If there is
no boundary, there is no possibility of physicality.
 We can call this a physical body, because
there’s a defined boundary.
 If there was no definition to this, this would 
not be physical.
 So everything physical has to have a defined
boundary.
 Entire human experience, right now, is coming
from this defined boundary.
 Whatever structures you try to create, whatever good
intentions you have, once again it ends up as one…
 one more boundary, one more division, 
one more segment in the world, one more caste
 or creed in its own way. Every one of these things which
have become terrible divisions in humanity,
 I believe they all started with good intention (Laughs).
 I don’t think they started with a negative
intention, but how many divisions have happened,
 how we have exploited each other. 
Talking about poverty, do we have the resource?
 Well, people are… I mean if you look at the numbers, you
said without a spreadsheet you can't make decisions,
 if you look at the spreadsheet of the differentiation
between what is poor, what is rich in this world,
 it's obscene, to say the least. I’m saying, people are
saying the amount of money spent on pet food
 in Europe and America is enough to take care of basic
health care for the entire humanity.
 I mean, it's obscene, to say the least. So this
has happened not with bad intention.
 This has all happened with good intention, but because
human experience is limited to their physical nature
 they’re trying to think beyond that, but you cannot
think beyond your experience.
 You can think, and again, you’ll end up in another 
cubicle, and another cubicle.
 So we’re talking about consciousness. 
When we say consciousness,
 we’re talking about a dimension beyond physical nature. 
When I say dimension beyond physical nature,
 what is physical to us, is all accumulated. This body is
an accumulation of the food that we’ve eaten.
 What we call as the mind, the content of the
mind is something that we accumulated
 by our impressions and experiences. 
What you accumulate can only be limited.
 You cannot accumulate unlimited.
You cannot accumulate that which is boundless.
 So now we’re talking about solutions in 
a boundless way.
 When we talk about solving problems seamlessly,
without thinking who is you and who is me,
 we need an inner experience which is 
beyond our physical nature.
 Only then, we will identify beyond this, because human
mind functions from the identities we have taken.
 Once we identify ourselves as something,
knowingly, unknowingly
 we are always trying to protect that identity. So to
bring a human being to that dimension of experience
 that he or she can function beyond identifications,
is what needs to happen.
 So when we say well-being, from the imperial
times, you know, well-being meant taking whatever
 is there everywhere and bringing it to one place,
and creating well-beings in certain people.
 We kind of evolved out of that. Now we are saying
well-being means this continent or that continent.
 Some people… you are a World Bank, you are
thinking of the entire world but we’re still
 leaving out a whole lot of things which are
part of our well-being,
 the well-being of every creature on this planet,
the well-being of every tree and plant,
 the well-being of every microorganism is
connected with our well-being.
 This is not ecological awareness, this is consciousness.
 If your experience of life was beyond the limitations of
your physicality, you would just know this by experience.
 When you know this by experience, you don’t have
to generate intention, you will just do the right thing.
 We have to bring the world to that place, 
that’s a long way, but at least we have
 to bring the leadership in the world to that place.
 When I say leadership, it is only a question
of maybe 5000 people on the planet.
 You know, when I was at the economic forum
they asked me, “Sadhguru, if there’s one
 think we can do for you which will change
the world, what is it?”
 I said, “I will name twenty-five people. You give them
to me for five days, you will see… in three years,
 you will see a significant change on the planet.”
They asked, “Who are these people?”
 I named the twenty- five heads of states of the major
nations on the planet. “Give them to me for five days.
 You will see everything will change” (Laughter), because
there is money, there is resource, there is technology.
 Only the intent is missing. But the intent is missing
not because of bad intentions, not because of some evil
 in their minds, intent is missing because there is
no larger experience within themselves.
 Annette Dixon: Thank you. I guess, the question I have is
that in…you know, you work and live in South Asia
 and I work in South Asia, and this is a region
where many groups are left behind.
 Sadhguru: Indians are feeling very insulted, you’re
not referring to it as south India (Laughter).
 Annette Dixon: Well, that’s another conversation
about (Sadhguru laughs)… about the continent,
 but my question is that, you know, we firmly
believe that you can't have development
 unless development actually reaches everybody,
that it is development for women and girls,
 it's development for people of tribes and ethnic
groups that are often left behind or marginalized.
 It's for people of all backgrounds, regardless
of their religion, their caste and their ethnicity and so on.
 So… And this is a constant challenge in development,
as how we actually ensure that development
 reaches all of these groups who have been
shut out of economic and social opportunity
 and who are unable to seize opportunity on the 
same terms. What's your thinking on this challenge?
 Sadhguru: See, by law, everybody is equal,
at least in India (Few laugh).
 No, there are countries where by law you are
not equal, especially genders are not equal.
 In India, by law, you’re equal but by practice, it's still not.
These are a thousand year old problems.
 They don’t get solved overnight. A sustained push
has to happen. The problem is of many levels.
 One thing is the democratic process itself addresses
people as religious groups, caste groups,
 because that is the way to get a bunch of votes. 
So every election, if you’ve forgotten your caste
 or religion, when the election comes, they’re going
to remind you who you are (Laughter).
 I’m saying that’s a reality in which you live. In case
you’ve forgot what is your caste and religion,
 when the election comes, they’re clearly 
reminding you, because
 people have understood the technology of
manipulating democracy.
 The science of how to manipulate democracy,
people have understood this number game,
 how to add up the numbers. It is no more about a
big pitch for… to where to take the nation.
 Everybody has understood the science of winning
an election, which I think is very dangerous
 and which I think is one of the most divisive
forces that are happening in India, at least.
 Otherwise generally, on a day-to-day basis,
most people don’t know what is their caste.
 Only when they want to get married, they check
a little bit (Laughter).
 Otherwise generally they don’t know what is their caste.
It's not… you are not reminded of that on a daily basis,
 but when the election comes you won't be spared,
you will be reminded (Laughs).
 So, some fundamentals have to change. Though by
law it is all equal, in practice, there is a difficulty.
 Definitely we’ve moved a long way, we’ve come a 
long way in the last twenty- five years.
 A big change has happened.
Those divisions are much less.
 There are more girls in school today than ever before.
Probably there are more girls in school than boys.
 In most of the villages, it is true. Where we are
running schools in southern India,
 generally sixty percent of the students are girls,
forty percent are boys, because boys like to do
 other things than studying. They don’t always come
to the school, but the girls come straight to the school
 (Laughs). So there is a certain… a natural studiousness
about them, or they’ve figured it out,
 unless they get educated, they’re just going to be
rubbished around, here and there.
 They clearly understand that. Boys still don’t get it
(Laughs), and probably for them,
 somehow they manage something around.
 So, how to level this, is once again, is a question of 
the consciousness of the leadership.
 When I say leadership, it's not just a question of
Prime Minister, Chief Minister, like this.
 A leadership... the tiers of leadership which
are down, they’re not in the same mindset.
 The Prime Minister may be having a certain thought.
The next level of…
 The Chief Minister’s thought is totally different. Down
the line, to the bottom most leadership
 which is Panchayat (Referring to Hindi word – a system
of village administration) is another world by itself.
 So this disconnect is there. I think right now, a serious
effort is being made to get everybody on the same pitch
 with the Prime Minister’s vision for the country. A pitch is
being made, but being a democracy
 election always round the corner, everybody
misunderstands this as a political intent.
 You don’t know whether to make out of it as a genuine
intent or a political intent to win the next election.
 I feel in a country like India; this may create lots of
trouble for me, but (Laughs) let me say it,
 in a country like India, I think we must skip one election,
that is, not every five years every ten years.
 Give them ten years to create something, because
in a nation like India, with a kind of diversity
 and complexities we have, I think any political
leader, to have any fair shot at creating
 something, he needs at least eight to ten years run.
 But the fear is always, if somebody becomes corrupt,
somebody becomes a despot,
 then you end up for ten years. What to do with him?
 So these problems are there, but these are
intrinsic problems to a democratic society.
 But all said and done, in terms of eliminating
caste, creed, religious bias, gender bias,
 the movement is tremendous. What has happened in
the last five years itself is quite tremendous.
 On the ground, there’s a huge change.
But still, if you don’t change rapidly enough,
 one generation’s life may pass. That is the concern.
 Annette Dixon: And in your work, you work
with leaders, and you said if you… if you
 had the opportunity to take twenty-five leaders,
we would probably say a hundred and eighty seven
 leaders, I think we have something like that
in our membership, but it would be helpful to me
 and others, I think, to understand, when you work
with leaders in your work, what are you trying to do
 and how do you do it with… in your work with them?
 Sadhguru: See, generally, I find though
there is a lot of opinion all over the place ,
 when you meet most of the leaders, they are
well-intentioned, but they are caught up in a mire of
 situations (Laughs). Democracy is an obligatory game.
 To climb up there, by the time you reach to
the top place, you’re obligated to so many people.
 When you sit there, if you don’t take care
of all these people, they all think you’ve betrayed them.
 If you take care of them, other people think
you’re corrupt. So this is a very funny game.
 That’s why I said if he has a long enough
term… he or she has a long enough term,
 maybe they could… maybe if they’re well
intentioned, they can go without these obligations.
 But my work with people has been… I’ve kept little focus
on politicians because their term is four to five years.
 You see in this country, I see election is on 
for... it's a four year term.
 Two years election campaign is going on. 
It's a four year term for the Presidency.
 Two years election campaign is going on. No. Some
time limit must be put, three months is enough.
 Let them prove themselves in three months.
Why does he take two years?
 Every day you watch the news, only election
is happening on the news channel.
 In India, I thought it's bad, it starts six
months ahead.
 I’m pitching not more than three months
there must be any kind of election work.
 Let them focus on administration.
 We elected them to administer, not to fight
one more election and one more election forever, okay?
 So I think somewhere, some limits have to
be put, because we have celebrated…
 I think moving from dictatorships and monarchies,
we’re kind of a little too thrilled with democracy.
 We need to understand, every system has its
flaws, and democracy has too many loopholes.
 Only thing is, at least the mistakes are a…
ours, you know (Laughs).
 It's not somebody else’s mistakes we suffer,
it's our mistakes we suffer.
 That is the only satisfaction we have. But yes, we’ve
decided this is the best way to run the world, that’s fine.
 But I think some limits have to be put. 
You can't run a election for two years.
 Election campaign cannot go on for two years. There
must be a limit four months, three months is enough.
 This is costing enormously. This is costing 
enormously for the lives of common people.
 And everybody… the entire country is in a election mood. 
For two years nobody is focusing on what
 they’re required to do. So the leadership… as political 
leadership, I’ve generally kept away for variety of
 reasons except those we find are visionary in nature.
 My work has been largely with business leaders
and bureaucratic leaders because these are
 people, who are there for a solid, minimum 
twenty- five to thirty years.
 These are the people, who can make a difference.
 So about eight years ago, we made a list of
2000 people in India, who are business leaders
 and bureaucratic leaders, who will definitely
be there for another twenty-five years in
 the country, doing things that they’re doing. They
may not be in the news, they may not be up there.
 These are not photo-op leaders, these are
real leaders, who are doing work on the ground.
 So, we made a list of these people and said, if we
can bring about at least ten percent change of heart
 in them, they can change everything in the country. 
So we aimed, in four years’ time,
 we will get these 2000 people but now it's
eight years or almost nine years now.
 We have touched about forty-six percent of this
leadership. They’re quietly making a change for sure.
 They are everywhere today, in the administration,
in the bureaucracy, in the business field,
 all of them making significant difference in the work
that they were... how they were working before
 and how they are working today, with what intention.
 My main work has been to shift people from
personal ambition to a larger vision.
 Personal ambition is a way of tweaking your desire,
you know (Laughs). People keep tweaking it every year,
 it gets little more and little more and little more.
And this is what is destroying the world.
 Why are you going in installments? Why don’t you
have a desire, you know (Laughs)?
 It's not by reducing desire the world will get better.
You just have to increase your desire.
 Why are you stingy with your desire, that
I have to live well, my family have to live well?
 Why don’t you make a real greedy desire,
I want everybody in the world to live the way I am?
 So I’m trying to increase their desire from being personal
ambition to a larger vision that we want to do this.
 So especially for business leaders - See,
whether you’re manufacturing a safety pin
 or a computer or a spacecraft, it doesn’t matter,
fundamental business is human well-being.
 Somewhere in these spreadsheets, I’m
sorry, I’m not referring to your spreadsheets (Laughter)
 this, you know, what do you call them, the 
balance sheets of three months, balance sheets,
 this quarterly balance sheets have become paramount
goals. You’ve forgotten why we’re looking at numbers
 is just to give us a guidance, are we going 
forward or backward.
 It is not an ultimate god-given thing to anybody.
 But now these quarterly balance sheets have
become the ultimate goals.
 So generally, my work is to move people from
this kind of short-term things
 to a larger vision that… be really greedy.
 If you manufacture safety pin, what should 
be your thing?
 All the seven billion people must use my safety
pin, the best safety pin, okay (Laughs).
 Similarly with everything else. I’m saying, instead
of trying to curtail human aspirations,
 which is never going to work. It's never going to work.
You can try as hard as you want.
 You can teach whatever philosophies
you want to people. They will all nod today,
 be content with what you have, tomorrow
morning they are on with their own stuff.
 So it is better to make an all-inclusive aspiration,
rather than trying to curtail aspiration.
 Curtailing aspirations have never worked.
 And one of the biggest things that I’m pitching
with the political leaders in India, and elsewhere also is,
 we need to curtail human population. That’s our only
problem. Nobody wants to address this.
 We took charge of certain things. There used to
be epidemics, there used to be serious infects…
 diseases and there used to be a certain number of
children dying before they reach four years of age.
 All these things we took charge. Once we take life
into our hands,
 we must understand that birth is also our business.
Once you postpone death,
 you also must postpone birth, isn't it? The beginning
of twentieth century we were 1.6 billion people,
 today we are nearly 7.2 or 7.3 billion people. In India,
in 1947 when we got our independence,
 we were just 330 million people, today we are 1.2 billion
people. So, four times in sixty seven years,
 I think it's irresponsible reproduction (Laughter). Yes.
 People are taking pride “We’re the youngest
nation, we’re the youngest nation.” So I asked…
 A minister was talking about how we are the youngest
nation. I said, “What happened to the old people?”
 He said, “What! No, no, we are the youngest nation.”
I said, “Fine. What happened to the old people?”
 Nobody got old, that’s not a great thing to gloat about.
In 1947, the life expectancy of an average Indian
 was twenty-eight years. Today, it's sixty- four. 
It’s a great thing.
 People are living longer, but that’s becoming our
curse because we postponed death.
 We must also postpone birth. We need to understand
this, otherwise whatever you do is not enough.
 Whatever you do is not enough. Just going on
doing more economic development,
 more economic development, is not a solution.
It's going to lead to a disaster.
 See, economic development is fine but there
is only that much world.
 People are talking about wealth generation.
There is no wealth generation.
 You can only take something that is here and put it there,
what is there you can put it here. It's the same planet.
 Today, the Living Earth Statistics tell us,
that if the entire world
 has to have what an average American citizen has,
if the seven billion people should have
 this kind of comforts and convenience and life
styles, we need four-and-a-half planets.
 But we have only half a planet left. In India, 
for example, with…
 I’m addressing this and we’re starting
movements to save some rivers now.
 A big movement is happening and fortunately
the government is responding very positively.
 Year on year, an average of eight percent
drop is happening in the river waters in India.
 So this is approximately sixteen to eighteen years,
most rivers will be gone. They will be just seasonal.
 Right now the major rivers, people who
come from south India, they have been fighting
 with this river between two states like Kaveri,
touches the ocean only five months in a year.
 Seven months it doesn’t reach the ocean.
This is true with most of the major rivers.
 It is not reaching the ocean.
It's getting all used up right here.
 So you do more development, more dams, more
people, more food, but there is no more.
 There is only this much. 
But we are nice, but we are too many.
 We don’t have to kill the people who are here, but we
can postpone the birth, which has to be done.
 And it's not a God-given duty for everybody 
to reproduce.
 If human race is in danger, everybody must reproduce,
but right now there is no such danger (Laughter).
 Every other creature is in danger. We should tell
the tigers to reproduce, elephants to reproduce
 humans, slow down (Laughter/Applause).
 Annette Dixon: And there are many young people
watching this (Laughter) and I’m sure that’s
 a message that probably has more resonance
for them than for me but… (Laughter)
 But more seriously, we were talking earlier before
we came down here, about the search
 that many young people have for identity and meaning
in the world, and the choices that they make.
 What message do you have for young people
and the role that they can play in making
 the world a better place?
 Sadhguru: See, when you say youth, you’re
talking about humanity in the making.
 That means you’re not fully conceited yet (Laughs). That
means you’re not set, you’re still an open possibility.
 So that’s a tremendous phase of life. Youth means,
it comes with enormous energy.
 Those of you, who are young, you don’t understand
what I’m talking right now (Laughs), because
 youth means it comes with enormous energy.
 Slowly, it doesn’t matter how well you keep yourself,
I think I kept myself pretty well,
 but still you don’t have the same energy. Well, I’m
doing better than most youth but (Laughs),
 but still you don’t have the same energy 
after some time.
 So this moment of enormous energy is the time
when we can make tremendous things happen.
 But unfortunately (Laughs), your intelligence may
get hijacked by the hormones,
 that you can't think straight (Laughs).
It just gets entangled into this and that.
 So this energy largely goes waste in anger,
in compulsions of various kind, this and that.
 If only youth invest a little bit in stabilizing themselves,
if you bring stability to your way of being,
 this energy can become a tremendous force. This
energy is a real solution to the world for everything.
 For every problem that you have, the energy
that the youth carries, if it had stability,
 it would become a solution for every problem
that we have on the planet, because that human
 energy is needed to make things happen.
 So as a part of this, we are going into schools this yoga
day, as I was telling you, 18,632 schools across India,
 we’re bringing a simple yogic practice, that we’re training
teachers so that they will sustain it for the children.
 To bring this balance, I’ll tell you how this balance is. When we opened our Isha Home School of… you know,
 a decade ago, one day I went in the morning to the
assembly, where all the tiny tots were sitting,
 all seven year olds are sitting. They are all like this, like
this (Gestures- makes restless movements) (Laughter).
 Then I said, why these kids have become like this?
They are like broken tops.
 So I just said, twelve minutes a day, we just 
brought some simple sounds.
 Seven notes of the Indian classical music.
Every day twelve minutes they do.
 After two months I go, they are sitting like this (Gestures
– indicates sitting still). That’s all it takes, I’m saying.
 The simple methodology of what brings stability
into a human being unfortunately is missing
 in our education systems. Our education system as it is, 
I mean, to the first question that you asked also
 Our education system is all about how
to exploit everything in the universe.
 Our idea of science is just this. How to use everything in
the world, including human beings (Laughs). Yes.
 How to use an invisible atom, how to use 
an invisible microbe,
 how to get protein out of bacteria (Laughter)… why (Laughs)?
 I mean, we are looking at the world as a killing field.
We are looking at the world as a way to squeeze it.
 This is fundamentally because we’re in pursuit
of happiness. This is the biggest problem.
 If you pursue happiness, you will endlessly
run, without ever finding it, because it's not out there.
 Every human experience, joy or misery, both
are generated from within us.
 If you know how to manage this, (Referring to oneself)
if your mind and your body took instructions from you
 keeping this healthy and joyful would be a 
natural consequence.
 Now your body is compulsive, your mind is in a
compulsive mode, and now you are in pursuit
 of happiness, this is a mad humanity, just ravaging 
through the world.
 The more empowered humanity becomes, the more
damage they will cause.
 Let us admit this much, it's the educated on the planet,
who have caused the maximum damage to this planet.
 Isn't it so? The uneducated don’t cause so much
damage. So our education has not brought sense to us.
 Our education has not brought life sense to us,
it has only given us empowerment as to
 how to squeeze life out of every damn thing in the
universe. So our mode of education has to change.
 Fundamentally, how to live, how to manage
this one (Referring to oneself) is not there.
 We know how to manage the entire universe, but we
don’t know how to manage this (Referring to oneself).
 What is it that human beings are struggling with?
Their thought and their emotion, entire life.
 They spend an entire lifetime still not knowing how to
manage their own thought and their own emotion.
 Something as simple as, let's say anger… from the
caveman till now, you’re getting angry the same way,
 isn't it (Laughter)? There’s no hi-tech way
to get angry (Laughter).
 Maybe today if you get angry, you don’t pick up a stick,
you pick up a nuclear weapon (Laughter),
 but the same anger, nothing has changed. I’m saying
such a simple emotion, we can't handle it. Why?
 Because the education systems have not given
a moment to the quality of what this is
 (Referring to oneself). We’re trying to teach discipline,
we’re trying to teach morality.
 People know how to subvert those things.
Only if you create an inclusive experience,
 then there is no subversion of that, because 
it is life enhancing in every way.
 Every moment, whatever every human being is trying is
just this in some way, to expand their experience of life.
 Somebody may think money will do it, somebody may
think wealth will do it, somebody may think knowledge
 will do it, or love will do it, basically what you’re thinking
is to be little larger than who you are right now.
 But if that happens, you want to be little
larger than that, if that happens, little larger than that.
 So you’re going in installments towards what?
 Fundamentally, you want to become boundless,
but you’re approaching boundlessness or infinite nature,
 in installments. Infinity in installments is a hopeless
case (Few laugh). It's a hopeless case.
 Even if you become the king or queen of this
planet, it's not going to stop. You’ll look at the stars.
 Already we are, isn't it? If you conquer five galaxies,
you think you will stop?
 Let's understand the fundamental nature of a human
being. We don’t know how to manage our minds,
 but we want to manage thousand people, 
obviously you’ll go bonkers (Laughter).
 So fundamentally, if your mind took instructions
from you, would you keep yourself blissful or miserable?
 It's a question. Hello (Laughter)? 
Participants: Blissful.
 Sadhguru: Blissful, isn't it? So, the fundamental
thing is just this nobody ever taught you
 from your kindergarten to your Ph.D. how to manage
this (Referring to oneself).
 So this is what needs to happen to humanity.
 They must know how to keep their body, how
to keep their mind, how to manage this.
 If you know how to keep this (Referring to oneself)
joyful…When you’re joyful… let me ask you this question,
 If I meet you when you’re very joyful, I’m sure you’re
a wonderful human being (Laughter). Yes or no?
 But if I happen to meet you when you’re angry,
when you’re frustrated, when you’re miserable
 about something, you’re depressed, you could be nasty.
Yes or no?
 Participants: Yes.
 Sadhguru: This is true with every human being. 
So, we have not taken care of the most fundamental
 thing, how a human being should be within himself
or herself. We are leaving it to ethics,
 morality and fixing the world. You fix the
world as much as you want.
 If you fix it any more, there’ll be no planet left,
(Few laugh) we have fixed it that far already.
 But still we are in pursuit of happiness. From pursuit of
happiness to expression of joy, if you do not shift,
 there’s really no solution for anything. 
Youth, this is the time to do it.
 The first thing before you step out into the world is, that
this (Referring to oneself) must be in a wonderful state.
 If this steps out in a wonderful state, it
will do only wonderful things.
 When you are feeling wonderful, are you not
wonderful to everything around you?
 That’s the only insurance you have (Laughs).
 Annette Dixon: I’m sure we have time for
a few questions.
 I think we have a question in the front row here.
 Questioner: I’m just wondering, if we gave
you the twenty-five leaders or the hundred
 and eighty seven leaders to lock up for five
days, when they came out of the room,
 what are the three things that we would notice
about them that would be different?
 Sadhguru: You would notice, they would be
much more joyful.
 You can always trust a joyful person, believe
me (Few laugh).
 Yes (Laughs), because when you’re joyful
you will not think of doing anything nasty.
 That’s true with all of you, isn't it? 
That’s true with every human being.
 But when you’re feeling nasty, there’s
every possibility you will find good reason
 to do something nasty (Laughter). Yes. You’ll find a very
good reason to do something nasty.
 And to be balanced, to be joyful, if these two things
happen, the third thing will be a consequence,
 that you will use your body and your mind to the best.
 There is substantial medical and scientific evidence
to show that if you’re in a pleasant state of experience,
 then your intelligence and your physiology 
functions at its best.
 There is lots of medical evidence today, to
show that for twenty-four hours,
 which has not happened to most human beings for
twenty-four hours if you spend without a moment
 of anxiety or agitation or irritation or stress
or anything, simply blissed out for twenty-four hours,
 if you stay like this, they say your intellectual
capacity would increase almost hundred percent,
 in twenty-four hours’ time!
 So we could do with little more sense on the planet,
for sure (Laughs), and we could do with little more joy.
 Questioner: I agree Annette, so…, Annette cannot deliver
the hundred and eighty-seven leaders, but
 (Unclear) you could deliver Jim Kem and his
management team.
 So (Laughter) that’s my proposal for you (Applause).
 Sadhguru: Okay (Laughs). Now she is setting the bar
(Applause). She is setting the bar to an impossible level.
 I’m saying, if these twenty-five people come,
others will simply follow (Laughs).
 Questioner: Thank you so much for coming. You 
were saying, if you live your life based on
 what you accumulate in the past so you can't go beyond,
right. So my question is how can you go beyond?
 Sadhguru: See, let's understand what is beyond,
right now. Right now, your entire experience of life
 is being gathered through the five senses of seeing,
hearing, smelling, tasting, touching.
 Everything that you know, all judgments that
you make, is coming from the information that
 you’ve gathered through five senses. These five
senses gathered information in a very fragmented way.
 In the sense, if you see this part of my hand,
you cannot see this (Gestures) part of my hand.
 If I show you this, you can't see this (Gestures).
This is not just with my hand,
 even with a grain of sand it's true, if you perceive
one part you can't perceive the other.
 And you know everything only by comparison.
 When I say comparison, suppose you were a tall person,
that is, you were six feet tall.
 Now you stand like a tall person, you walk like a tall
person, you think like a tall person,
 you feel like a tall person, you are a tall person. You went
to another society where everybody is eight feet tall.
 Suddenly you stand like a short person, walk like a
short person, think like a short person,
 feel like a short person, and you are a short person.
 So what I’m saying is, what you perceive in comparison,
is not perception, it's a distortion of reality.
 It is good enough for survival in a particular
situation, but you don’t know anything about
 anything around you, because you perceived
everything only as it is relevant to your survival.
 To such an extent you do not even know what is
light and darkness. That’s insulting, isn't it?
 You’ve seen an owl? The bird, the owl? If you and
an owl sat together and started an argument
 as to which is light and which is darkness, where would
you it go (Laughter)? Endless argument.
 I’m asking who is right. You or the owl? Who is right?
 Participants: Both.
 Sadhguru: Both, ah! If you’re saying both, either you
are in the diplomatic core (Laughter), or (Laughs)…
 or you have a successful marriage (Laughter).
You’ve learned to say both,
 both to everything, otherwise you won't survive (Laughs).
I’m asking, which is the truth? Which is light, I’m asking.
 You don’t really know. That’s the fact of the matter. What
you see as light, somebody else is seeing as darkness.
 What is day for you is night for somebody else, isn't it?
And there are more night creatures on this planet.
 Just if you hold an election, and if you gave everybody a
franchise, the night creatures will win hands down,
 because their numbers are huge, all right (Laughs)?
 So what I’m saying is, your sense organs are good
enough instruments for survival,
 but once you come as a human being, 
survival is not good enough, isn't it?
 Till it is taken care of, it's a big issue. Once it's taken
care of, doesn’t mean anything,
 because for every other creature, there’s only one
issue for them stomach full, life settled for them.
 But for a human being, stomach empty, only one
problem food. Stomach full, one hundred problems
 (Laughter). Yes. Who has more problems?
Poor or the rich? The rich have complex problems.
 Poor have only one problem, food. They truly believe
this one thing is taken care of, everything is settled.
 Only when it is settled, they know it is not so,
because the nature of the human being is like this.
 For every other creature, their life ends with fulfillment
of survival process.
 For a human being, life begins only after survival
process is taken care of.
 So, what is beyond, is in many different ways. 
The simple thing is this, these five sense organs,
 because they are survival instruments, the moment
you were born, they came awake.
 You could see, you could hear, you could smell
and all this stuff.
 But anything beyond survival, unless you strive,
it’ll not come into your life.
 So this striving to know beyond sense perception
has not happened to a large segment of humanity,
 because that’s been taken out of our
education systems.
 There was a time when that was an important
part of growing up in the world,
 but today we’ve completely banished that, because
our entire education system is somehow
 machine you into a right shape and size so
that you fit into the economic engine.
 It's a very gross way of running the world.
 If you’re willing to commit thirty hours
of focused time, we will give you a vehicle
 through which you touch something which is
beyond sense perception.
 Questioner: Thank you so much for a truly inspiring talk.
I have two quick questions for you.
 The first one is, according to you what would
be the best school for learning to manage
 oneself, if you had three tips per day or per week?
 Sadhguru: You should not go to that school
which gives you those three tips (Laughter).
 Questioner: If one feels that there should
be harmony in the world, and a lack of inequality,
 how can we accept that we have strayed so
far away and where can we find some deeper
 answers to why we’re here and what we can
do to live with more harmony?
 Sadhguru: First let me give you a tip (Laughter).
The fundamental tip is this.
 You know when… Can I share something with you?
 When my girl was growing up, I made one rule
around me, nobody should teach her anything,
 because the biggest problem in the world is 
this the moment you are born,
 every idiot wants to teach you something (Laughter).
Something that has not worked in their lives (Laughter).
 I said nobody teach her anything, just leave her alone.
 I just made sure she has enough exposure to nature and
life around, but human beings don’t teach her anything.
 Any of your tricks she doesn’t need. So she grew
up very joyfully.
 When she was around thirteen, she had some…whatever,
some little emotional stuff and she came to me.
 And she asked me, “You never told me anything,
you know. You’re always teaching the world.
 You never told me anything.” I said, “See, there’s only one
thing I want to tell you,” because I knew her (Laughs)
 current state at that time, and I told her
just this, “This one thing you fix it in your head.
 Never look up to anybody. Never look down on
anybody.This is all.
 No looking up to anything. No looking down on anything.
Just look at everything just the way it is.”
 That’s all it takes to make a beautiful life out of
this (Referring to oneself).
 The problem is you’re looking up to something.
This means authority has become the truth in your life.
 Truth will never be the authority in your life.
 If truth is not the authority in your life,
you will never know what this life is about.
 You may do patchy things here and there.
 The moment you look up to something, it is inevitable
that you will look down on something else. Yes or no?
 The moment you look up to something, can you
avoid looking down on something else?
 In one stroke, this will destroy both heaven
and hell for you, and you will live on this planet.
 And when you know you have to live on this
planet, you will sensibly (Laughs).
 Because you think you’re going somewhere else,
you’re doing all the rubbish here
 because you want to go to some other place
(Laughter).
 And about harmony. How many human beings or
how many of you can really put your heart on your hand
 and say that if you sit in one place,
you’re really harmonious within yourself?
 I want you to understand, the world that you
see is a manifestation of what's happening
 in individual human beings. Because it's magnified,
it looks ugly, but it's ugly on small scale too.
 So, you know, people come to me and tell me,
“Sadhguru, my husband, ah” (Laughter)!
 And, “My mother-in-law, she is beyond everything,”
“My boss…” like this, wife, husband, mother-in-law,
 this person, that person. So I tell them, “You come,
don’t worry, you come in the Yoga center. You stay.
 We will not let your husband, wife, mother-in-law
(Few laugh), father-in-law, nobody. Just you.
 I’ll give you a nice place to stay, good food to eat.
Don’t have to do anything. Just be joyful, that’s all.
 Any way we have prevented all of them from
coming. You be joyful (Laughter).
 Random checks I will make. When I check,
you must be joyful (Laughter).
 Otherwise I don’t believe in feeding misery, you
know (Laughter).” Oh, you leave them in one place
 for twenty-four hours, you must see in how
many ways they’ll twist themselves!
 When you are alone if you are miserable, obviously
you’re in bad company, isn't it (Laughter)? Hmm?
 If there is no harmony in this (Referring to oneself), how
do you expect to bring harmony in such a large world?
 If you can't bring harmony to this mind, 
if you can't manage this,
 how do you manage the world efficiently and well?
 Till human beings… individual human beings
work upon themselves, there is really no solution.
 There is no such thing as global solution.
 It is individual emancipation which will lead 
to the world’s emancipation.
 When you and me are doing great, the world
is doing great, isn't it?
 World is just a word, humanity is just a word,
you and me are a reality.
 Without addressing the reality, we are pumping
slogans which have no connection with reality.
 We want to fix the world. Where is the world?
It's you and me, right?
 If you and me are not… don’t fix ourselves,
then fixing the world is just a popular slogan.
 At one time, I went to all these World Peace
Conferences. I got invited here, there.
 I thought really something is going to happen.
Then I looked.
 In one of these peace committees (Laughs)
where about forty-three noble laureates were there,
 I just asked them because I looked at them,
when I looked at their faces, I knew
 these people have not known peace for
a moment in their life (Laughter).
 I just asked them, “Genuinely tell me, except when you’re
sleeping–” which some of them were doing (Laughter),
 “– except when you’re sleeping, have you known
genuinely, what is peace within you?”
 They were sincere enough. They said, “No, we 
don’t know.” Then don’t talk about world peace.
 There is no such thing. If you and me are peaceful,
the world will become peaceful.
 If you and me are loving, the world will become loving.
 If you and me are blissful, the world will become
blissful. The only problem is human mind.
 But human mind is the most wonderful gift
that we have.
 I’m saying the best gift that you got, you made a curse
out of it, because you’ve been given a super computer,
 but you’ve not bothered to read the user’s manual.
This is your problem (Laughter). Yes.
 You’ve not read the user’s manual, how
to manage this (Referring to oneself).
 And then this intelligence, this is the greatest thing.
 This cerebral capability that the human beings have,
is the greatest thing that’s happened to us.
 It took millions of years of evolution to
get to this place, but now this is a curse.
 What are you suffering? You’re suffering your own
intelligence, please know this. Yes or no?
 If I take away half your brains, most of you would
be peaceful (Laughter). Yes. Harmonious (Laughs)!
 In harmony with everything. So I am saying the
best thing that you got, you made the worst out of it.
 Because no user’s manual. Because your education
systems, or family systems, or the national cultures
 have no sense about how to manage this
one (Referring to oneself).
 We are always thinking how to conquer the world.
 There are two ways you can take the world, you can
either conquer the world, or you can captivate the world.
 If you captivate the world, the world will come with you.
 If you conquer the world, you have to sit on top of it
and struggle for the rest of your life.
 Questioner: Thank you Sadhguru. Question. You talked
about working on yourself and meditation comes into it.
 Yet I’ve seen plenty of meditators that don’t seem to
act that well. So can you talk about that a bit?
 Sadhguru: (Laughs) I’m not in any way identified
with any political nation on the planet,
 but when I use the names of countries, don’t
think it's from some prejudice.
 When anything comes to America, it takes on a different
form. It just amuses me what forms it takes (Laughs).
 Because… The yoga, for example. 
What forms it's taken is (Laughter)…
 Well, yesterday somebody sent me a Whatsapp
message about how they’re propagating beer yoga
 (Laughter). Okay. So yogis who have drinking problem,
and drinkers who have yogic problem (Laughter),
 they do beer yoga. Okay, like this there are many
(Laughs). So we need to understand this.
 This is not… When you say meditation, when you
say yoga, this is not an Indian thing or an Eastern thing,
 as it is being understood. This is paying attention
to the inner nature of who you are, all right?
 Fortunately, the fundamentals of being human, 
is same fundamentals
 doesn’t matter which continent you have come from.
 Though for a long time people have been prejudiced
against… one against the other,
 but fundamentally, these creatures are made the same
way. This entire species is made the same way, okay?
 On the surface, maybe I’m made of chocolate and you
are white chocolate, whatever (Laughter),
 okay (Laughs), that’s different. So we need to understand this. For example, you used the word
 “meditation”. You must understand this, these words
are being thrown around.
 The word “meditation” in English doesn’t
really mean anything specific. It's too general.
 If somebody sits with their eyes closed,
you will say they’re meditating.
 You know, with your eyes closed, how many
things you can do (Laughter). Yes or no (Laughs)?
 So in the yogic parlance, you can do japa, tapa, dharana,
dhyana, samadhi, you can fantasize about something,
 or you can just master the art of sleeping in
vertical postures (Laughter), you know (Laughs).
 You don’t know what you’re doing. So
specific aspects are not there.
 General, because it's a fashion, it is not an endeavor,
it is more a fashion it's an in-thing.
 You will see people are walking with yoga mat in 
New York City. You ask them, “What?”
 They say, “Today is my yoga day. Yesterday was
my cycling day. Tomorrow is my swimming day.”
 This is not like that. The word yoga means union.
 Union means, in some way, you learn to obliterate
the boundaries of your individuality,
 because your individual existence is a fake existence.
if you don’t understand
 what I’m saying, close your mouth, hold your nose
like this (Gestures) for two minutes.
 You will understand, without the larger atmosphere
supporting you, you can't exist for a moment. Yes?
 What you exhale, the trees are inhaling, what the
trees exhale, you are inhaling every moment of your life.
 But this is not there in your experience. Actually one
half of your breathing apparatus are hanging out there.
 If you experience this, do I have to tell you, 
don’t cut the tree,
 do I have to tell you something else like this,
to plant the tree? It wouldn’t be necessary.
 If you really experience one half of my lungs is hanging
out there, you wouldn’t call a tree a wood, isn't it?
 If I call you “flesh” is it an insult or no? So calling a
living tree as wood! (Laughs) See this happened to me.
 You know, when I was in… doing literature,
this… we were always studying English poetry,
 and we were introduced to American poetry.
 So the first day this lady teacher comes and
she says, “I’m introducing Robert Frost
 to you and he is a great poet,” and this,
this, this.
 She says so many things and then she starts
off, “Woods are lovely dark and deep…” I said, “Stop!”
 I was only nineteen. I said, “Stop.” She said, “Why?”
 I said, “A man, who calls a tree a wood,
I’m not going to listen to that guy” (Few laugh).
 She said, “No, no, this is a great poet.”
I said, “I don’t care how great he is.
 A man, who calls tree a wood, I’m not going
to listen to that guy.” I didn’t let her teach (Laughs).
 Because this has gotten into our minds. We have
not experienced life. We’ve concluded about everything.
 We’ve made conclusions about everything.
We’ve not experienced it.
 If you sat here and experienced life, very 
well you would know, what the trees exhale,
 you’re inhaling every moment. You can do
without any relationship in your life.
 This one relationship you can't break. Yes or no?
 Participants: Yes.
 Sadhguru: We have not brought human
beings to experience.
 Meditation means this, yoga means this, to
bring people to a living experience of life.
 It’s not just the trees and the atmosphere.
 As you sit here, every subatomic particle
is in communication with the rest of the universe,
 otherwise you can't exist here for a moment. This entire
fake idea of who you are has to go. That’s meditation.
 So any way, technically what is meditation?
 Meditation is a consequence, but because these
societies have become so goal-oriented,
 they want the mango, they don’t want the tree. 
If you want flowers in your garden,
 you don’t have to do flower meditation. 
You don’t even have to think flower.
 You have to think soil, manure, water, sunlight.
 None of them look like flowers, but if you
take care of that, flower is a consequence.
 So meditation is a consequence, but people
want the consequence, not the process.
 If you cultivate your body, your mind, your 
emotion and your energies to a certain level
 of maturity, you will become meditative.
 That will be your quality, that will be the
fragrance that you’ll carry with you, but
 now you want the fragrance, you don’t want
the process, what will you do?
 You’ll buy some French perfume (Laughter/Applause).
 Annette Dixon: Thank you very, very much (Applause).
 The Bank will be very different for having
had this experience, so thank you for the

With the objective of reducing the number of pending UCs, the Ministry had taken the initiative to streamline the procedure for sanctioning grants under various sports and youth schemes. In so far as various youth schemes are concerned, all State Governments/UT Administrations have been assigned a greater role in pre-appraisal, scrutiny and prioritization of NGO proposals for consideration by the Ministry. The Ministry has also launched a drive to reconcile UCs in respect of grantee institutions and NGOs who have received grants under different schemes of the Ministry. As per the provisions of Rule 209/211 of the General Financial Rules, notices have been issued to all defaulting NGOs to submit UCs and accounts, failing which they would be blacklisted after following the prescribed procedural steps in this regard. While the recovery from grantee organizations of unutilized Government grants together with the penal interest as specified in the GFR is an ongoing process, action has been initiated by the Ministry against defaulting NGOs in a number of cases.","minister","ls14","2007","200711","20071128","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2007","131755","184651","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrimanishankaraiyar","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2007","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2007","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2007","l14_nt_2007","inc_qna_2007","inc_nt_2007","other","n200711","l14_qna_200711","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","YouthAffairsandSports","athenumberofNGOswhohavenotsubmittedUtilizationCertificatetilltheendoffinancialyear200607StatewisebwhetherthereissomeinvolvementofMinistrysofficialsorlackofinitiativeonthepartoftheofficersfornotpursuingNGOstosubmittheUtilizationCertificatecifsothedetailsthereofanddthespecificinitiativeseffortsmadebytheGovernmenttorecovertheamountfromthedefaultingNGOs","newdelhi",247

State governments with funds constraints in view have justified the construction of `Kachcha` roads on the grounds of the need for rural link roads and to provide maximum wage employment at minimum capital cost. The primary objective of both the JRY and the EAS was generation of employment opportunities for the rural people living below the poverty line. The programme guidelines therefore prescribed wage material ratio of 60:40 which the implementing agencies were required to adhere to while selecting and executing works.","minister","ls13","2002","200207","20020716","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2002","60536","105375","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrisubhashmaharia","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2002","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2002","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2002","l13_nt_2002","bjp_qna_2002","bjp_nt_2002","other","n200207","l13_qna_200207","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","RuralDevelopment","awhetherasumofRs16464crorewasspentontheconstructionofKachcharurallinkroadsinsomeoftheStatescontrarytotherequirementofconstructionofdurablenaturebetween199299ashasbeenmentionedintheCAGReportNo3of2000CivilinParagraphNos4123atpage222bifsothedetailsthereofandthereasonsthereforecwhethertheGovernmenthaveenquiredintothematterdifsothedetailthereofetheactiontakenagainsttheauthoritiesforspendingthepublicmoneyandfthestepstakenbytheGovernmenttoensurethatthemoneyisspentjudiciouslyforthebenefitofthecommonmanatlarge","newdelhi",166

"i528089","t20080417558549","  (a) to (e): A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (e) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.373 BY SHRI HARIKEWAL PRASAD, MP TO BE ANSWERED ON 17TH APRIL 2008 REGARDING SUPPLY OF UNDERWEIGHT GAS CYLINDERS.(a) to (e): The possibility of diversion of subsidized domestic LPG cylinders by some unscrupulous elements cannot be ruled out due to the wide gap between the retail price of LPG for domestic use and the market price for commercial LPG. Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have reported that based on the established complaints of supply of underweight cylinders / pilfering product by LPG distributors action has been taken in 56 cases during 2005-06, 29 cases during 2006-07 and 55 cases in April, 2007-February, 2008 as per provisions of Marketing Discipline Guidelines (MDG) / Distributorship Agreements. The State-wise details of complaints received is available with the Directors (Marketing) of OMCs. OMCs have further reported that they have terminated 38 LPG distributorships during the period April, 2005 to February, 2008. The State-wise details of terminated LPG distributorships is annexed. Whenever OMCs receive complaints, these are investigated and if the complaint is established, suitable action is taken against the LPG distributor(s) in accordance with the provisions of the MDG. MDG provides for following action against the distributor:-  # Fine of Rs.20,000 plus the price of LPG diverted at commercial rates for 1st offence.# Fine of Rs.50,000 plus the price of LPG diverted at commercial rates for 2nd offence.# Termination of the distributorship for 3rd offence. In addition to the action taken by the OMCs, State Governments are empowered under the LPG (Regulation of Supply & Distribution) Order, 2000 promulgated under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 to take action against blackmarketing of domestic LPG. Similarly, the Weights and Measures Departments of the States / UTs initiate legal action against those LPG distributors found supplying under-weight LPG cylinders. The State Governments have been alerted from time to time to take steps against the black-marketing of domestic cylinders for unauthorized usage. Government have issued advertisements cautioning the public that use of domestic LPG for non-domestic purposes is illegal, dangerous and against national interest. Through these advertisements, cooperation of the general public is also sought to report any irregularity / malpractice to the OMCs. The officials of OMCs carry out checks at distributors__ godowns, delivery points, as well as en-route to ensure that no pilferage takes place. The distributors of OMCs are under strict instructions to check the weight of cylinders at their godowns before delivery, and only cylinders with the specified weight are to be delivered to the customers. The distributors have also been instructed to ensure that the seals are verified & shown to the customers at the time of delivery. In case any under-weight cylinder is received by the customer, such cylinders are replaced free of charge by the OMCs.

"i589958","t20120822479731","  (a) to (d): The Government is already following National Policy on Education, 1986 (as modified in 1992), which provides for National System of Education implying that up to a given level, all students, irrespective of caste, creed, location or sex, have access to education of a comparable quality. The National System of Education envisages a common educational structure. The 10+2+3 structure has now been accepted in most parts of the country. The National System of Education is based on a national curriculum framework, which contains a common core along with other components that are flexible. The common core includes the history of freedom movement, the constitutional obligations and other content essential to nurture national identity. These elements cut across subject areas and are designed to promote values such as Indias common cultural heritage, egalitarianism, democracy and secularism, equality of the sexes, protection of the environment, removal of social barriers, observance of the small family norm and inculcation of the scientific temper.","minister","ls15","2012","201208","20120822","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2012","166172","252267","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","drdpurandeswari","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2012","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2012","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2012","l15_nt_2012","inc_qna_2012","inc_nt_2012","other","n201208","l15_qna_201208","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","HumanResourceDevelopment","awhethertheGovernmentproposestoimplementauniformeducationpolicyacrossthecountrybifsothedetailsthereofandthereasonsthereforcthemodalitiesbeingworkedoutinthisregardanddthetimebywhichthisuniformpolicyisproposedtobeimplemented","newdelhi",164

The data generated by these networks are useful in understanding the seismicity and seismotectonics of the region. Seismic microzonation study of Delhi-NCR has been carried out on 1:50,000 scale to provide additional inputs relating to the effects of the underlying soil on the structures in the assessment of damage potential. These seismic microzonation maps are useful in land use planning and formulation of site specific design and construction criteria for the buildings and structures towards minimizing the damage to property and loss of life caused by earthquakes.","minister","ls15","2012","201205","20120503","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2012","183439","247022","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","drashwanikumar","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2012","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2012","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2012","l15_nt_2012","inc_qna_2012","inc_nt_2012","other","n201205","l15_qna_201205","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","EarthSciences","awhethertheGovernmenthasconductedanystudyregardingfrequentearthquakesinDelhiNCRandbifsothedetailsthereofandtheactiontakenbytheGovernmentthereon","newdelhi",110

Safdarjung Hospital, Dr. RML Hospital and LHMC & Hospitals are concerned, there is shortage of doctors in these hospitals due to retirements, resignations and natural wasting. The replacement is a continuous process. The vacancies are as follows: Safdarjung Hospital  -  46  Dr. RML Hospital  -  89  LHMC & Hospital   -  81  However, Sanitation and hygienic conditions of these hospitals are satisfactory. Infection Control Committee already exists in these Hospitals. Filling up of the vacant posts of doctors is a continuous process through UPSC after completing the required formalities.

Mahatma Gandhi

Advanced countries have embraced fiscal activism, giving a greater role to counter-cyclical
policies and attaching less weight to curbing the debt stock. But India’s experience has
taught the opposite lessons. It has reaffirmed the need for rules to contain activism, so
as to rein in excessive spending during booms and inordinate deficits during downturns,
a pattern that contributed to both recent episodes of severe macro-economic instability
and 2013). India's experience has also highlighted the risk of relying on rapid
growth rather than steady primary balance adjustment to reduce debt, a strategy that has
failed to place the debt-GDP ratio firmly on a downward path. These flow and stock
vulnerabilities are the subject of review under the new FRBM Committee.

Introduction
Since the government came to power,
there has been a steadfast commitment to
fiscal consolidation, reflected in the steady
decline in the fiscal deficit from 4.5 percent
of GDP in 2013-14 to 4.1 percent, 3.9
percent, and 3.5 percent over the successive
three years. What should be the direction
of future fiscal policy? This question has
become salient for both international and
domestic reasons.
Since the 2008-09 Global Financial
Crisis (GFC), monetary policy has
experienced a paradigm shift. Called upon
to shore up economic activity in the face of
severe tailwinds, monetary policy makers have
ventured into realms they had never been
before: near-zero interest rates, quantitative
easing in the form of exploding central bank
balance sheets, and eventually, upturning all
normal intuitions, even to negative interest
rates so that economic agents are actually
paid to hold money.
Now that monetary easing has run
its course, attention has increasingly turned
to the role of fiscal policy. And here too
there has been a paradigm shift. This shift
in conventional wisdom, articulated most
clearly recently by Jason Furman of President
Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers1,
comprises the following:
Fiscal policy can legitimately be used for
counter-cyclical policy;
It is particularly effective when monetary
policy is at the zero lower bound, because
at that point multipliers are large, close
to 1.5;
And because fiscal policy is effective in
increasing GDP, it will lead to significant
increases in tax revenue, meaning that
fiscal activism can partly pay for itself
Gaspar, Obstfeld, and Sahay 2016);
In any event, estimates of sustainable
debt levels should be revised upwards,
because interest rates will remain low;
Finally, debt sustainability is ultimately
less about the ability to pay and more
about the willingness of the political
system to honor its obligations.
In other words, the new view of fiscal
policy shifts the emphasis from stocks to
flows, arguing for greater activism in flows
deficits) and minimizing concerns about
the sustainability of the stocks (debt). Of
course, since the US elections, it seems that
activist fiscal policy might become a reality,
even though, ironically, cyclical conditions
have changed, as low unemployment is now
leading to rising wages and inflation.
How well does this view apply to India,
given its fiscal experience in the last 15 years
and its outlook for the next 10-15 years? This
is a question that is imperative at a time when
India is reviewing the fiscal policy framework
enshrined in the Fiscal Responsibility and
Budget Management (FRBM) Act of 2003.
II. India and the World: Flows
The case for activist fiscal policy in the
advanced economies (AEs) rests ultimately
on two pillars: weak economic activity and
the inability to address this problem through
monetary policy.
These considerations have some
resonance in India. Like some European
countries, India is still afflicted by the twin
balance sheet problem, which is holding back
investment and credit growth and hence
overall economic activity. Deleveraging has
still not played itself out and hence the
debt overhang will continue to constrain
economic activity (see Chapter 4). The need
for counter-cyclical policy cannot therefore
be ruled out.
That said, India’s situation differs
from that of the AEs in some important
ways. To begin with, Indian growth rates
are substantially higher, while inflation rates
are also substantially greater. As a result,
monetary policy is nowhere close to the zero
lower bound, reducing the need for fiscal
activism. And because inflation is already
relatively high, counter-cyclical policy has to
be much more sensitive to triggering higher
inflation. Potential growth is notoriously
difficult to estimate, especially in India, but
one recent attempt suggests that the room
for increasing demand without triggering
higher inflation may be limited (Chinoy,
Kumar and Mishra 2016).
Perhaps a more important argument
against activist counter-cyclical policy is
India’s own recent experience. Figures 1 and
illustrate this history. Figure 1 highlights
starkly that the two episodes of Indian macrovulnerability
in the last 35 years—1991 and
2013—were associated with, even preceded
by, large increases in fiscal deficits. In the early
1980s, there was an expansion in spending
and deficits in response to accelerating
growth. The inability to rein in these deficits
played a key role in undermining India’s
external situation, which led to the balance
of payments crisis of 1991. The difference
between the 1991 and 2013 episodes is that
in the former there was a fixed exchange rate
which created a full-blown crisis, whereas
in the latter the exchange rate was floating,
which attenuated disruptions in other asset
prices.

Figure 2 focusses on the period leading
up to the 2013 crisis. During the mid-2000s
growth boom, new spending programs were
introduced, which could not be sustained
when receipts fell back to more normal
levels. Then, after the Global Financial Crisis
there was a renewed surge in budget deficits,
which rose to exceptionally high levels. This
boom-financed spending (since 2005-06)
combined with the sharp stimulus (4 percent
of GDP) in the wake of the GFC, which was
then not withdrawn adequately or on time,
led to the financial-currency “near-crisis” in
the autumn of 2013.

In other words, India’s fiscal stance
has an in-built bias toward higher deficits,
because spending rises pro-cyclically during
growth surges, while revenue and spending
are deployed counter-cyclically during
slowdowns. This pattern creates fiscal
fragility. Fiscal rules, insofar as they can be
effective and binding, must therefore aim
to prevent spending surges during booms
and constrain counter-cyclicality during
downturns.

India and the World: Stocks
India also appears to have a stock
problem, in that its debt-to-GDP ratio is
higher than many other emerging markets
Table 1). But such a mechanical comparison
is not an appropriate way of assessing India’s
fiscal strength: the true problem is muchIII. India and the World: Stocks
India also appears to have a stock

Table 1). But such a mechanical comparison
is not an appropriate way of assessing India’s
fiscal strength: the true problem is much
more subtle.

Fiscal commitment
India shares with AEs the experience
of not having defaulted on its domestic
debt either de jure or de facto (through long
periods of high inflation). In that sense,
India is very different from many other
emerging markets, especially those in Latin
America (and Russia) which have defaulted
on their domestic obligations. If fiscal and
debt sustainability is about confidence and
trust as revealed in the ability and willingness
of governments to limit their debt levels and
pay them off without disruption, as Reinhart,
Rogoff and Savastano (2003) suggest, then
India’s record is very good. In the recent
past, India’s highest level of debt has been
percent of GDP and it has made sure
that its debt service obligations have been
conscientiously met.
Indeed, India’s experience on its
external debt obligations is instructive.
When doubts about India’s ability to meet its
debt service obligations to foreign creditors
arose in 1991, the government took extreme
measures to reassure creditors that it had no
intention to default. Gold from the RBI was
flown in a special plane and placed in the
vaults of the Bank of England to provide
collateral and demonstrate India’s seriousness
about its debt obligations (Sitapati, 2016).
b. Debt dynamics
Turn next to debt dynamics. The basic
equation for debt sustainability is:
where:
dt refers to the debt/GDP ratio in period t;
pdt, the primary deficit in period t;
gt, the nominal GDP growth rate; and
rt, the nominal effective rate of interest
borrowing cost) on government debt.
This equation shows that if a
government is running a primary deficit,
pd, then nominal growth must exceed the
nominal interest rate ([g - r] must be positive)
to keep debt from increasing. In contrast,
if the primary balance is positive, then debt
ratios can remain steady even if [g - r] turns
negative.
On both [g-r] and pd there are interesting
comparisons to be made. In AEs, low
inflation rates and weak economic activity
in the aftermath of the financial crises have
reduced nominal growth, which on its own
would create debt fragilities. But at the same
time secular trends related to high savings,
ageing, and a worldwide increase in demand
for safe assets have reduced equilibrium
interest rates, as well. In other words, both
g and r have fallen, keeping debt dynamics
sustainable.
In India, things are rather different.
India is on a convergence path. Being
relatively less developed, its growth rate
for the next decade or two is likely to be
substantial. This dynamic has been evident
for the last two decades. The country has
grown at just over 6 percent in real terms for
years and the scope for continuing this
convergence remains considerable. India can
grow conservatively at about 7-8 percent for
the next 15 years (5.5-7 percent in per capita
terms). This combined with an inflation
target of 4±2 percent implies that nominal
GDP growth over the next decade or so will
be in the 11-14 percent range.
The implications for the growthinterest
rate differential are stark. For AEs,
g –r] could remain in the 0-2 percent range,
comprising 1-2 percent trend real GDP
growth plus 1-2 percent inflation, less 2
percent for the nominal interest rate. But for
India the differential could be around 4-6.5
percent, reflecting the high nominal growth
rates less interest rates of 7-7.5 percent
inflation plus a country risk premium). As a
result, debt dynamics for the next decade will
be very favorable for India compared with
most AEs and even other emerging markets.
But what about the other dimension of
debt dynamics, pd, the primary deficit? Here
too there is a contrast with AEs, but in a way
that reveals an Indian vulnerability.
This vulnerability is the country’s
primary deficit, that is the shortfall between
its receipts and its non-interest expenditures.
Put simply, India’s government (centre and
states combined) is not collecting enough
revenue to cover its running costs, let alone
the interest on its debt obligations.
There is nothing extraordinary about
running a primary deficit, per se. Most of the
other large emerging markets do so, having
fallen into this situation after the Global
Financial Crisis when GDP growth and
revenues slowed, while stimulus spending
was increased (Table 2). Even so, India stands
out both for the size of the deficits that it
has run over the past decade, especially when
compared with its rate of growth. At such
rapid rates of growth, substantially greater
than those of its peers, its primary deficit
should have been much lower than others;
instead it has been significantly greater
Figure 3).
As a result of running a primary deficit,
the government is dependent on growth and
favourable interest rates to contain the debt
ratio. In fact, in the aftermath of the GFC
as growth slowed and disinflation occurred,
debt levels started to rise again (Figure 4).
It follows that if one day growth
were to falter and interest rates to rise on
a sustained basis, the debt ratio could start
to spiral upwards. A debt explosion would
admittedly require a large, unlikely shock.
But it is not just a completely theoretical
possibility, either: it is exactly what happened
to Greece.
This contrast between India’s primary
balance position and that of other countries
reflects a deeper point. India normally
undertakes policy-related fiscal adjustment
only gradually. Aside from crisis periods, the
fiscal position has only improved sustainedly
when it has benefitted from windfalls, arising
from exceptional growth (as in the mid-
2000s) or major declines in oil prices that
allow for lower petroleum-related subsidies
and higher excise taxes. For example, between
2014-15 and 2016-17, lower oil prices will
have contributed about a percentage point
to fiscal adjustment. Notice that in Figure 4,
the primary balance line is relatively stable,
and the improvement around 2007, reflects
the growth boom while the strengthening
towards the end coincided with low oil prices.
Conclusion
It has now been thirteen years since the
FRBM was enshrined in law and the basic
principles of prudent fiscal management
elaborated. Over this period, the situation in
India has changed utterly. Back in 2003, the
economy was fairly small and still relatively
closed to the outside world, generating per
capita incomes that lagged far behind that
of other emerging markets. Today, India
has become a middle income country. Its
economy is large, open, and growing faster
than any other major economy in the world.
In many ways, then, India’s economy
is converging toward the large, open,
prosperous economies of the West. But its
trajectory is different in one fundamental
way. While India’s pace of growth has
quickened in the past quarter century, the
dynamism of advanced countries has ebbed,
particularly since the Global Financial Crisis.
And this has led to a fundamental divergence
of fiscal perspectives. Back in 2003 there
was common agreement that fiscal rules
were better than discretion, that fiscal policy
should be aimed at medium-term objectives
such as reducing the stock of debt rather than
shorter-term cyclical considerations. Now,
advanced countries have moved away from
these principles toward greater fiscal activism,
giving counter-cyclical policies much more
of a role and giving correspondingly less
weight toward curbing the debt stock.
But India’s experience has taught the
opposite lessons. It has reaffirmed the need
for rules to contain fiscal deficits, because
of the proclivity to spend during booms and
undertake stimulus during downturns. It has
also highlighted the danger of relying on
rapid growth rather than steady and gradual
fiscal and primary balance adjustment to do
the “heavy lifting” on debt reduction. In
short, it has underscored the fundamental
validity of the fiscal policy principles set out
in the FRBM.
Even as these basic tenets of the FRBM
remain valid, the operational framework
designed in 2003 will need to be modified
to reflect the India of today, and even more
importantly the India of tomorrow. This,
then, will be the task of the FRBM Review
Committee: to set out a new vision, an FRBM
for the 21st century.","admin","ecos","2017","201701","20170102","201617","na","nda2","nationalpol","report","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","english","na","xxxxx","esu2017","1519","691083","notrans","collective","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","ecos","others","others","others","tech","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","esu_rep","na","yes","others","na","bjp","esu_nt","esu_nda2","bjp_esu","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","na_esu","na_nt","na_nda2","adm2017","adm_esu","adm_nt","adm_nda2","esu","esu","esu","esu","esu","esu","esu","esu","esu","adm","adm","adm","adm","adm","adm","adm","adm","adm","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","esu","adm","others","esu","adm","others","esu","adm","others","esu","adm","others","esu_rep","adm_rep","o_rep","esu_nt","adm_nt","o_nt","rep_nda2","adm_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","english","eco1998after","esu","nt","rep","na","bjp_esu","bjp_rep","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_esu","lib_rep","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2017","lib_bjp_rep","esu_rep_2017","esu_nt_2017","bjp_rep_2017","bjp_nt_2017","other","n201501","esu_rep_201701","esu_rep","esu_rep_l","esu_rep_l","esu_nt_l","adm_esu_l","adm_nt_l","esu","esu","esu_l","esu_l","esu","esu","esu_l","esu_l","E","E","El","El",NA,NA,NA,2556

Based on the recommendations of the Appellate Body, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) ruled that the Domestic Content Requirement (DCR) under Phase I and Batch I & Batch II of Phase II of Indias Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) programs is inconsistent with WTO Agreement as it discriminates between the products manufactured domestically and the imported products. Government of India has provided a number of schemes for the purpose of extending support to the domestic manufacturers.

Out of 583 projects 11 are ahead of schedule, 158 projects are on schedule, 284 projects are running behind schedule with respect to their original approved date of commissioning; and 130 projects do not have any date of commissioning.(c) Yes, Sir.(d) The cost and time overruns in these projects are largely attributed to funds constraints, problems faced in land acquisition and forest/environmental clearance, slow progress by contractors, adverse law and order situation in some regions of the country, delay in supply of equipment by domestic/foreign vendors, change in scope of projects leading to increase in Bill of Quantities (BOQ), geological surprises, increase in interest on borrowed capital during construction, exchange rate variations in projects funded by external sources, high cost of rehabilitation, general price rise of cement and steel, etc.(e) The corrective steps taken by the Government to minimize cost and time over-run of such projects inter-alia include:  (i) adoption of two-stage clearance system and stricter appraisal of projects before investment approval;  (ii) taking up of projects for implementation only after funds have been fully tied up;  (iii) in-depth review of projects on monthly and quarterly basis by the Government;  (iv) follow up with the State Governments in respect of problems relating to land acquisition, rehabilitation related issues, forest clearances, infrastructure facilities, ensuring law and order at project sites, etc.(v) setting up of Empowered Committees in different administrative Ministries for review of the departmentally executed projects;  (vi) inter-ministerial coordination for resolving unresolved problems;  (vii) setting up of Standing Committees in the Ministries/Departments to fix responsibility for time and cost overruns;  (viii) appointment of nodal officers for each project with continuity of tenure; and  (ix) issue of guidelines on standard bidding documents for adoption.","minister","ls15","2009","200907","20090715","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2009","168356","199014","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","independentcharge","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2009","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2009","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2009","l15_nt_2009","inc_qna_2009","inc_nt_2009","other","n200907","l15_qna_200907","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","StatisticsandProgrammeImplementation","awhethertheMinistryhasmonitoredexecutionofthemajorcentralsectorprojectsbifsothedetailsthereofcwhetherthereasonsforthecostandtimeoverrunsinrespectofsuchprojectshavebeenidentifieddifsothedetailsthereofandethecorrectivestepstakenbytheGovernmentinthisregard","newdelhi",376
"i24648","t19340202789558","FRIENDS,
It is a matter of great joy to me to be able to see you this
afternoon. I was looking forward to coming to this beautiful hill. I
know that some of my co-workers have been zealously working in the
midst of hillmen. I know, too, that you have not that vicious kind of
untouchability amongst you that we have on the plains. Nevertheless,
no one, in India, can be absolutely free from that virus. Even you have
distinctions of high and low. And so long as we have got that habit of
considering ourselves higher than somebody else, we have not got rid
of untouchability, and so long as we have got that distinction in our
midst, remember we have not got rid of untouchability. Therefore, I
published in Harijan, 9-2-1934.
would like all to consider and to know and realize that we are all
children of the same God, and that therefore among us, His children,
there can be nothing like some being high and some being low, and
that all should have the same rights as everyone else.
And then, I want to draw your attention to one thing, of which I
have just heard, that hillmen are very much given to the habit of drin-
king intoxicating liquors. Those who are given to that habit should
realize  that  it  is drink  which  makes  man  thoroughly  mad.  In-
toxicating liquors are in no way necessary for retaining ourselves. Not
only so, a man who drinks, very often, more often than not, forgets the
distinction between his own wife and his own mother. Drunken men
and drunken women also have been known all the world over to do
things of which they would be ashamed if they were sober. Only
yesterday, I heard as I  was driving  that  two drunken  men  were
quarrelling amongst themselves, with the result that one died on the
spot, and the other is now lying in the hospital. As this is a movement
of self-purification, I would like every one of those who are given to
this vicious habit to come to a firm resolution never more to touch
fiery liquors. It will be a matter of very great joy to me if my fellow-
workers are able to report to me that many of you have given up
drink altogether.
Now, whilst I thank you for these coppers and silver pieces that
you have given me for the Harijan cause, I have to ask you to give
some more coppers and some more silver for another cause which is
as sacred as the Harijan cause. In the north of India, there is one of
our  fairest  provinces.  The  name  of  that  province  is  Bihar,  the
birth-place of Sita. It was there that only a few days ago, a terrible
earthquake took place. Several thousands of men died. Many more
thousands of men and women are lying in hospitals. The whole world
is directing its atten-tion to the afflicted people of Bihar. Thousands
upon thousands of men and women are homeless, shelterless and
clothless. Many palace-like buildings are now simply heaps of broken
bricks. It is for these that I would like you to give the most, and not
the least, that you can. If you have not got sufficient money on your
persons, make collections after I  am  gone;  you  can  make  them
tomorrow and send them either to Patna to Babu Rajendra Prasad, who
is in charge of the relief work, or you can bring them to me whilst I
am still in Coonoor. In many places, remember, men and women have
denied themselves their food, their clothes, and shared them with those
who are suffering that terrible affliction.
For me, personally, this earthquake has a much deeper lesson
than that it has brought physical ruin to thousands of homes. It is my
firm conviction that such calamities descend upon mankind from time
to time as a fit punishment for its sins. I love to think that it is a
punishment awarded to us for the great sin of untouchability. If you
cherish that belief with me, you will take care to remove the least taint
of untouchability from your midst. May God help you and me to
realize this dream that India should be free once more from all kinds
of impurities.

"i42801","t19461023325650","ANDREW  FREEMAN:  Has the spinning-wheel a message for America?  Can it
serve as a counter weapon to the atom bomb?
GANDHIJI:   I do feel that it has message for the U. S. A. and the
October 23.
whole world. But it cannot be until India has demonstrated to the
world that it has made the spinning-wheel its own, which it has not
done today.  The fault is not of the wheel. I have not the slightest
doubt that the saving of India and of the world lies in the wheel.  If
India becomes the slave of the machine, then, I say, heaven save the
world.
India has a far nobler mission, viz., to establish friendship and
peace  in  the  world.  Peace  cannot  be  established  through  mere
conferences.  Peace  is  being  broken,  as  we  all  see,  even  while
conferences are being held.
A.  F.    It seems so tragic.  India must lead the way and India is in turmoil.  If
any country can really take up the wheel, it is India.  Do you think it will?
G.  It is doing so, but I confess the process is very slow. Pandit
Nehru called khadi the “livery of our freedom”.  It cannot be that so
long as it is the consolation of cranks and paupers only.  There are
many  things  that  are  not  possible  for  man  to  accomplish.  But
everything is possible for God.  If there is no living power called God,
the spinning-wheel has no place.
A.  F.    Those who spin are not called cranks here.
G.  No. I used that expression to anticipate what Americans
would say.  I allow myself to be called by that name to protect myself.
I was described by a friend as a ‘practical idealist’.
A.  F.    As a fairly intelligent human being and an American I can only say that
though many Americans would call spinners cranks, there are not a few who are
thinking  hard.   Something  has  to  be  found that  would save  civilization  from
destruction.  Life must be simplified.
G.  Human personality cannot be sustained in any other way.  I
stand by what is implied in the phrase ‘Unto This Last’.  That book1
marked the turning point in my life.  We must do even unto this last as
we would have the world do by us.  All must have equal opportunity.
Given the opportunity every human being has the same possibility for
spiritual growth.  That is what the spinning-wheel symbolizes.
A.  F.    Would you like the Americans to take to the spinning-wheel?
G.  Yes.  But I do not know whether it will be taken up by
anybody  before  it  is  well  established  here.  If,  on  the  other
hand,  India  adopts  it  for  clothing  itself,  I  won’t  need  to  tell
the world.  It will adopt it of itself.  Today there is such an onslaught
on  India  of  Western  machinery  that  for  India  to  withstand  it
successfully would be nothing short of a miracle.  I must confess that
today  everything  seems  to  point  to  the  contrary.  Look  at  our
internecine quarrels.
A.  F.    But you have not given up hope?
G.  I cannot, so long as I have faith in that living Power which is
more with us than we know.  But let me ask you a counter-question.
Has America with all its Mammon-worship abolished unemployment,
poverty, corruption, Tammany Hall?
A.  F.    The answer is obvious.
G.  Has England?  Has it not still to grapple with the problems
that baffle her?  It is a very curious commentary on the West that
although it professes Christianity, there is no Christianity or Christ in
the West or there should have been no war.  That is how I understand
the message of Jesus.  There is much ignorance and superstition in
India.  But deep down in us is that faith in God—the instinct for
religion.
A.  F.    All newspapermen and others have sensed that.  But I must confess
there are moments when I feel it is hopeless.  Look at the recent attack on Pandit
Nehru in the tribal areas from which I have just returned, and the happenings in East
Bengal.  You too must at times have felt the hopelessness of it all.  Would you say
Islam has repudiated its teacher, as Christianity of today has its Jesus?
G.  I have said so openly. Where is Mohammed and his message
which  is peace?    I  said  recently  at  a  public  gathering  that  if
Mohammed came to India today, he would disown many of his-so-
called followers and own me as a true Muslim, as Jesus would own me
as a true Christian.
A.  F.     How can we bring men back to God or to the teaching of Jesus or that
G.  I might give the answer  that  Jesus  gave  to  one  of  his
followers: “Do  the  will  of  my  Father  who  is  in  Heaven,  not
merely  say  Lord,  Lord1 .”  That  holds  true  of  you,  me  and
everybody.  If we have faith in the living God, all will be well with us.
I hope not to lose that faith even to my dying day.  In spite of my
numerous failings and shortcomings of which I am but  too  well
aware,   my   faith   in   God   is   burning   brighter   every   day. If
it did not, I would take the same prescription that I gave1 to women
threatened with dishonour and with no prospect of help or escape, viz.,
commit suicide.
A.  F.    Have you thought of the charkha as a therapeutic agent?
G.  Yes.  I have read some literature on the subject sent to me by
a Glasgow professor.  A retired Superintendent of a jail in Bengal too
wrote to me describing the use of the spinning-wheel for  curing
lunatics, particularly by virtue of the soothing effect of its rhythmic
motion.

"i14173","t19281025698514","Salem, Coimbatore and other areas in the Tamil country whose peasant
population depend on the unsteady rainfall of the central districts are having
one of their very worst years. Reports from khadi centres show a terrible
increase in rural unemployment. With October, the season for agricultural
work generally begins and the peasant women in the khadi areas usually close
down their spinning for the next four months. A certain number spin all the
year round, but the majority who can work in the fields generally leave the
charkhas during this time. But this year instead of a fall in the number of
spinners there is an increase and a great rush for cotton at our depots.

The reader must remember that this rush is for a wage of one anna a day.

When will the intelligentsia of India and the well-to-do realize that the
cloth that we wear is not mere covering or adornment, but a vital part of the
national economy, a channel for distribution of national resources; and that
clogging this is death? We can give substantial relief to the people at
Pudupalayam and other famine-stricken areas where we have been enabled to
set up khadi centres if only people will help us by a quick and generous
consumption of the khadi that we produce. Ready consumption means room
for more spinning and distribution of much needed relief among the Starving
people. Sjt. Santanam desires to organize the maximum spinning in the
Pudupalayam area in this period of distress there, and if we get public
sympathy and support, he hopes to organize sale of food grains and seed at
cheap fixed prices, the deficit being met from famine relief fund to be raised. . .

The way the public can help is
(a) by sending liberal orders for khadi;
(b) by sending donations either for distributing grams free or at rates
within the means of the famishing people, or for supporting spinning centres
where initial outlay will be a necessity.
C. RAJAGOPALACHARI
I hope that this appeal will receive a generous response. The
appeal is evident]y written in a hurry and without possession of full
facts. But past experience shows that in such cases a general description
draws a picture less terrible than a mere narrative of ‘facts
reveals. The reader will therefore not wait for a detailed report before
he opens his purse-strings. I hope too to be able shortly to give a
rough forecast of the requirements. Let the reader remember also that
the best help that can be rendered” is to help to clear the stock of
khadi that is being and will be manufactured. When khadi becomes
current coin, though scarcity of rainfall will be always with us, there
need be no distress such as would compel people to live on charity.
While hand-spinning is being organized on a national scale, some
charitable relief will be found necessary to meet emergencies. For all
the famine-stricken people are not ready or able to spin, nor has the
nation provided facilities in every village for willing spinners.

"i54607","t20090616894189","I wish to take this opportunity to once again thank His Excellency
President Medvedev for hosting the first BRIC Summit.

We have just concluded useful discussions in the restricted format on
some of the major issues before us.

When we review the global financial and economic situation, it is worth
recalling that when we met at the Second G–20 Leaders' Summit in April
this year we realised that the global downturn was much more severe than
what we had anticipated in Washington D. C. in November last year.

In London we were successful in agreeing on several short term measures
to infuse greater liquidity, make good the decline that has taken place
in capital flows to developing countries by providing adequate resources
to the international financial institutions, and agreeing on a broad
direction for improvement in the regulatory and supervisory structure for
the world's financial system. We also agreed on the need to develop an
effective early warning system which can identify the build up of risks
which may threaten global financial stability.

There was a unanimous view that protectionism or restrictions on the free
flow of trade and persons are counterproductive, and pose a particular
threat to recovery in the developing world. The stark collapse in world
trade has heightened the importance of an early completion of the Doha
Round of talks keeping in mind its development dimension.

We also recognised the continuing need to redefining the role of
institutions of global economic and financial governance to deal with the
problems of today and to reflect contemporary realities. The broadening
of representation in the Financial Stability Forum and the Basle
Committee on Banking Supervision, the two key standard setting bodies,
has been a useful development in this context.

We were able to identify areas for further improvement in the functioning
of multilateral institutions. In the case of the IMF, these related to
its surveillance function, its lending role, augmentation of the IMF's
resources and governance reforms. In the case of the World Bank, three
specific points of action were identified – (i) a substantial increase in
lending, (ii) a review of the Bank's lending capacity and capital
adequacy and (iii) enabling large developing countries to access required
levels of finance through increased lending limits so that they can
support recovery in their regions.

The important issue today is to implement the decisions that we have
taken. Finance Ministers and Central Bank representatives of BRIC
countries have met and identified the areas where our efforts should be
focused. Our countries should also keep in contact with each other in the
run up to the next G–20 Leaders Summit in Pittsburgh.

Our cooperation in the G–20 process must be backed up by cooperation in
the real economy. The volume of trade among BRIC countries has grown
rapidly in recent years. Intra–BRIC investments have also grown. We
should consider the establishment of a BRIC Joint Business Forum which
can identify areas for cooperation such as science and technology,
energy, agriculture, aviation, pharmaceuticals and services.

In India, we have launched a number of fiscal stimulus packages including
additional public spending, amounting to over 3percent of our GDP. Our monetary
policy initiatives have been targeted towards maintaining a comfortable
liquidity position and ensuring that credit delivery remains on track.
Our banking system remains well regulated, capitalized and profitable.

The Joint Statement and the Statement on Global Food Security that we
will be adopting later today provide a road–map for our future work.

I wish to congratulate His Excellency President Medvedev for his guidance
and leadership during this Summit, and for the successful outcomes that
we have reached today.

The Honourable Dr. B.R. Ambedkar (Labour Member) : Sir,    I move:
“That the Bill to impose on employers a liability to pay compensation to workmen sustaining war injuries and to provide for the insurance of employers against such liability be referred    to a Select Committee consisting of Sir Vithal N. Chandavarkar, Mr. N.M.  Joshi,  Mr.  Jamnadas  M.  Mehta,  Mr.  D.S.  Joshi, Mr. Ilooseinbhoy A. Lalljee, Khan Bahadur Mian Ghulam Kadir Muhammad Shabhan, Mr. C.C. Miller, Mr. K.L.C.

Gupta and the Mover, that the number of Members whose presence shall be necessary to constitute a meeting of the Committee shall be five and that the Committee be authorised to meet at Simla.”
Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Abdur Rahim): Has the honourable member given the names ?
The Honourable Dr. B.R. Ambedkar : Sir, I will  hand  over the list now.
Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Abdur Rahim): The names ought to have been given earlier.
The Honourable Dr. B.R. Ambedkar : Sir, I do not think   it would be necessary for me to take much time of the House       in order to command this measure to the Honourable members. The main provisions of the Bill are three.  The  Bill  seeks  to  give compensation to workmen who may become victims of war Induries ; secondly, the Bill seeks to make employers liable for such compensation; and thirdly, the Bill seeks to compel employers to insure against liabilities imposed upon them.
Now, taking the question of compensation, the point to which I wish to draw the attention of the House is that this Bill is a linked measure. It is linked to Workmen’s Compensation Act. Now, Sir, the relationship
 

 
of this Bill to the War Injuries Ordinance to which I have made   a reference is plain. As Honourable Members will recall, the War Injuries Ordinance, 1941, defines what is called the qualifying injuries. Those injuries are classified in that Ordinance. What  the present Bill does is to adopt in the main  the  scope  and  limits of the qualifying injuries as has been defined in the War Injuries Ordinance. As to the question of relationship of the present Bill to the Workmen’s Compensation Act that will be clear to the Honourable Members from the fact that the amount of compensation which has been fixed in this Bill for the victim   of war injuries more or less follows the scale that has been fixed in the Workmen’s Compensation Act.
Now, Sir, the reason for bringing this measure is this : After the War Injuries Ordinance was passed in 1941 a question was raised, a question which is of substance and if I may say so, of some importance and that question is whether the payment made to a workman who unfortunately happened to sustain what is called the qualifying injuries should be a sort of relief or should be compensation. The difference between relief and compensation is quite obvious. Relief is merely to help a person to get over     the difficulties to which he might be reduced by reason of the incapacity which he suffers by a war injury and which prevents him from earning him normal wages. Compensation, on the other hand according to the terms of the  Workmen’s  Compensation Act, seeks to make payment which compensates him fully for the loss which he incurs. When this question was raised a reference was made to the conditions that were prevailing in England and it was found that the British Parliament passed an enactment which is known as the War Injuries Miscellaneous Act of 1936. On examination of the provisions of this English Law it was found that the payments which were allowed under that Act amounted to compensation and not merely relief. Obviously the question arose whether it was not desirable for the Government of India to follow the principle which was laid down in this English statues. Secondly, some of the employers, on their own accord after the passing of the War Injuries Ordinance of 1941, addressed a letter to the Government of India stating that from their point of view the provisions made in the War Injuries Ordinance were not sufficient for the maintenance of the morale of labour and that compensation should be paid in order that the labourers working in


disturbed areas may remain steady at that work. From  both these points of view the Government of India accepted the principle of giving compensation to workmen in place of what was originally thought to be only relief.
On examining the provisions of the War Injuries Ordinance,  it was found that at a level of about Rs. 24, the payments made under the War Injuries Ordinance constituted not only relief but also compensation. What is therefore necessary to do is to give the workman drawing a salary above Rs. 24 additional rebate which will make payments made to him amount to compensation; that is to say to supplement what  he  gets under  the ordinance so that what he will get will  also  amount  to  compensation.  This measure therefore is a measure which is a supplementary measure, which supplements the provisions of War Injuries Ordinance of 1941.
Having explained to the house the main provision, namely    of compensation and how the Bill was linked up to the War Injuries Ordinance as well as to the Workmen’s Compensation Act and having explained to the house the reason which led the Government of India to bring in this supplementary legislation,   I will proceed to explain the second main provision of the Bill, namely to  make  the  employer  liable  for  such  compensation.  It might be said that while under the provisions of the War Injuries Ordinance, it was government which was undertaking the liability to pay relief, the Government also should undertake similar liability for making compensation to those to whom this present Bill applies. It is quite obvious that it is not possible      for Government to undertake the liability which under the circumstances of the case may almost amount to anything because if India remains as it is, there may be no liability arising out       of this. Or, if the situation worsens, the liability may be quite indefinite and having regard to the capacity of the Government of India, it is quite obvious that the Government cannot be asked to undertake such indefinite liability. Secondly, I do not think that much can be made of the fact that Government is not undertaking liability in this matter for it will be realised that whatever amount of compensation the employer may be called upon to pay under the liability which we are imposing upon him, it would    no doubt be regarded as an admissible revenue expenditure
under E.P.T., and consequently in the main the burden would ultimately fall upon the Treasury.
I might also mention  that  while  the  Government  of  India is seeking to impose this liability upon the employers, the Government of India is not forgetting its own obligations to its own employees. Honourable members will find a clause there stating that this Bill does not apply to servants of the Crown      or to employees of the Federal Railway. But that does not mean that these employees are not going to get the benefit similar to those which we are providing in this Bill. I should like to inform the House that the Federal Railways as well as the Government of India have informed their employees that they would be prepared to extend the provisions of extra pensions which are contained in the Civil Service Regulations and in the Statutory Rules governing the employment of railwaymen.
Now, Sir, the third provision which seeks to compel the employer to ensure the liability imposed upon him is, I claim       to be, a very necessary and a very  salutary  provision.  The  object of making this provision is to ensure that the workmen     at all time will get the compensation for which this Bill seeks     to make provision. It may be, as the House may well realise,   that if a factory is bombed or demolished, the assets of an employer are destroyed and if any provision of the sort that is sought to be made in this Bill is in existence, notwithstanding  the benefit which the Act extends to the workmen, it may in     the final analysis leave the workmen where they are without   any opportunity of getting compensation which is provided for. Insurance therefore is guaranteed to the workman that in all circumstances the benefits which the Bill seeks to give him will be there for him, if he is so unfortunately situated as to receive the war injury. The working  of  the  system  will  be somewhat as follows. The payment will be made by the employer to the employee in the first instance in regard to  the  terms  of  the  Bill. The employer will be reimbursed out of an insurance fund which may be managed by the Government. The employer will contribute to this insurance fund the premium which will be settled at the end of the war when the total liability will be known. In the meanwhile, Government will be recovering advances from employers against the final premium which will be settled after the war. The quantum of advance will vary from quarter    to quarter. In the first quarter the advance will not exceed

eight annas per 100 of the Wage bill. For subsequent quarters it will change depending upon the liability that may be outstanding. It may be that there have been no casualities in the preceding quarter. If that is so, it is obvious that no advances will be recovered from the employer. As I said, the advantage of the insurance scheme is that it ensures the workmen a payment, secondly the risk is distributed-safer areas which are not exposed to any attack will also be contributing towards the payment of compensation to workmen living and working in areas which have been attacked. Thirdly, the burden is proportionate because it is based upon the Wage bill of each employer.
It will therefore be seen, Sir, that the Bill is a very simple measure. I would also say that it is a non-controversial measure. The House would like to know that the idea of the Bill came   from the Millowners Association  in  Bombay  in  the  beginning of 1942. After the suggestion was sent to the Government of India, there was an informal conference held in April 1942 between the Secretary of the Labour Department, Sir Henry Richardson, Sir Frederic James, Mr. Haddow, Mr.  Gwilt  and  Mr. Hooseinbhoy Lalljee. On their suggestion, the employers were consulted, two employers organisations were approached and two All-India organisations of Industrial employers have completely supported the measure. With regard to employers Federation, that organisation unfortunately was divided. One section is in favour, and the other is not. So far as labour representations    are concerned, the Standing Labour Committee unanimously recommended this measure. I do not think that anything more is necessary to enable the house to understand fully the provisions of this Bill. Sir, with these remarks, I move.

The Honourable Dr. B.R.  Ambedkar :  Sir,  I  am  glad  to find such a general support accorded to the measure which       I had the pleasure of moving this morning. The words of  criticism which have emerged are indeed surprisingly few and most of them came from my Honourable friends, Mr. Miller and Mr. Joshi. My Honourable friend, Mr. Miller, said that it was necessary that the Government should give more information with regard to the measure.  I  shall  always  be  glad  to  give him whatever information he wants if he would kindly let me
know the points which are troubling his mind. With regard  to  the other question which he raised, namely, that in his mind there appeared a certain discrimination between the rates we were paying under the War Injuries Ordinance and the rates    we proposed to pay under the present measure, I fear he is labouring under a misapprehension because, as I tried to make out, the object of this measure is really to equalise the position   of those who are  covered  by  the  War  Injuries  Ordinance  and of those who are going to be covered by the present measure.     As I pointed out, on examination of the rates we offered to the war injuries victims, we found that those who drew Rs. 24 and above only got relief and those who drew Rs. 24 and below got compensation. And what we propose to do now by this measure is to give compensation to those who stand above Rs. 24. Therefore, my Honourable friend will see that far from creating a position which will be called discriminatory, we are really equalising the position of all workmen to which both these measures are going to apply. I quite appreciate the point that my Honourable friend, Mr. Miller, made, namely, that this measure is restricted to a certain type of workmen or certain classes of workmen who are defined in clause 5. That is quite obvious from the provisions      of the Bill itself. But, as I pointed out, having regard to two circumstances, firstly, that it is not possible for Government to undertake the liability of paying compensation to all workmen and, secondly, having regard to the fact that any scheme of insurance which Government can put forth must be administratively workable, it follows that  Government  cannot  spread  itself out to cover all sorts of workmen  because,  as  I  said,  it  would be too much of liability for Government to  take  and  the scheme will become administratively unworkable. In order that we may run the insurance scheme, it is quite obvious that we must be able to locate an employer on whom we can definitely place the liability and from whom we can recover the  premium.  In the case of general population it is not possible to locate someone     on whom this liability could be imposed and from whom the premium could be demanded. That is certainly the reason why  we have been required to limit the scheme to certain classes of workmen who have been defined in clause 5. My Honourable friend, Mr. Miller,  said  that  we  have  given  no  justification  for confining our scheme to the classes of workmen who have  been defined in clause 5. Some of the answers which I could

have given to him have already been given by my Honourable friend, Mr. Joshi, and I do not propose to repeat them. The answer really is to be found in the Statement of Objects and Reasons itself. The Statement of Objects and Reasons (paragraph 2) makes it clear that they are exposed to danger in factories and other industrial concerns. That, I submit, is as good a reason      as any could  be given for confining  this measure to the classes  of workmen who are defined therein. It cannot be denied that factories and industries are easy targets for enemy attack and  the people working there are, therefore, more exposed to danger than the general population.
With regard to the question raised by the Honourable friend, Mr. Joshi, that this Bill does not apply to all workmen and he pointed out two particular cases in which he desired that the provisions of this Bill should be extended, namely, to the labourers working in Assam on tea plantations and seamen, are, no doubt, cases which require some particular answer. Now, Sir, my general answer to the criticism of Mr. Joshi, with regard to these two particular points is this, that Government is quite  aware  of  what he has said and that is the reason why Government has introduced sub-clause (c) in clause 5, whereby Government has reserved to itself the power of extending the provisions of the   Bill to other workmen employed in any employment. Government does not regard that the categories of workers defined are the final and that no occasion may arise to include others.
Dr. P.N. Banerjea : It is not exhaustive.
The Honourable Dr. B.R. Ambedkar : It is not exhaustive and, therefore, if a situation arises when it becomes clear to Government that the provisions of this Bill should be extended   to workmen employed in other employments, Government will undoubtedly consider the matter.
With regard to the question of Assam, the  only  point  I  would like to make is this  that,  as  I  said,  we  are  confining  the measure to workmen who are living in  what  might  be  called exposed centres. To my mind and according to the information we have at present, it cannot be said that the tea plantations are exposed centres. If at any time the plantations   do become exposed centres and subject to  risk,  there  is  no  doubt about it that either Mr. Joshi may move in the matter or

 
Government will take notice and see that the provisions of this Bill are extended to the labourers in Assam.
With regard to the seamen, I think the matter was brought forward by the Commerce Department and I understand that there is a measure already in existence whereby a provision, if not of the same force, at any rate, analogous to the scheme that we are having, is already in existence. If my Honourable friend, Mr. Joshi, thinks that it is desirable that the Select Committee should examine and make some provision, if that provision is    not incongruous with the main features of the Bill, I certainly  will raise no objection for his considering the matter in  the  Select Committee.
My Honourable friend, Mr. Miller, referred to one or two clauses in the Bill. The first was sub-clause 5(3). To that I have given my reply that Government has deliberately introduced  that sub-clause by way of caution because Government thinks that the expedience may arise whereby the  provisions  of this Bill may have to be extended.
The other section to which he referred was section 10 of sub-clause (3). His point of criticism was that by this provision Government proposes that if any balance is left out of the fund the excess will be paid into the general revenues. I understood Mr. Miller to say that this policy of the Government of India    was not  justified  by  the  circumstances  of  the  case.  But  if  Mr. Miller will bear in mind the fact to which I have already referred, namely, that a good part of the money which will be paid as premia by the employers to this fund will come out of   the E.P.T., then it is only proper that Government should be the residuary legatee of such balance. Sir, I have nothing more to say.
Mr. E.L.C. Gwilt (Bombay: European): May I ask a question from Honourable Member ? He said in his opening speech that    it is the Millowners’ Association that initiated the scheme.
The Honourable Dr. B.R. Ambedkar : They made a suggestion.
Mr. E.L.C. Gwilt: Did not they also make a suggestion that any money left in the fund after the compensation is completely paid should be devoted to industrial research and if so, will my Honourable friend give consideration to that suggestion ?
The Honourable Dr. B.R. Ambedkar : I have no memory, but I will look into the matter.


Mr. Chairman (Syed Ghulam Bhik Nairang): The question is :
“That the Bill to impose on employers a liability to pay compensation to workmen sustaining war injuries and to provide for the insurance of employers against such liability be referred    to a Select Committee consisting of Sir Vithal N. Chandavarkar, Mr.  N.  M.  Joshi,  Mr.  Jamnadas  M.  Mehta,  Mr.  D.S.  Joshi, Mr. Hooseinbhoy A. Lalljee, Khan Bahadur Mian Ghulam Kadir Muhammad Shahban, Mr. C. C. Miller, Mr. E.I.C. Gwilt, Maulana Zafar Ali Khan, Mr. Yusuf Abdoola Haroon, Hajee Chowdhury Muhammad Ismail  Khan,  Mr.  H.A.  Sathar  H.  Essak  Sait,  Mr. Amarendra Nath Chattopadhyaya, Mr. R.R. Gupta and the Mover, that the number of Members whose presence shall be necessary to constitute a meeting of the Committee shall be live and that the Committee be authorised to meet at Simla.”
The motion was adopted.

The growth strategy of Tenth Plan would lay emphasis on rapid growth of those sectors which are most likely to create high quality employment opportunities and deal with the policy constraints which discourage growth of employment. Particular attention will be paid to the policy environment influencing a wide range of economic activities which have a large employment potential. These include sectors such as construction real estate and housing transport Small Scale Industry (SSI) modern retailing Information Technology (IT) enabled services and a range of other new services which need to be promoted through supportive policies. Emphasis will also be laid on tourism to ensure realization of full potential of this activity. Employment Strategy in the Tenth Plan will focus on employment growth and on the qualitative aspects of employment. In order to enable the poor to access the opportunities and to ensure consistency between the requirement and availability of skills emphasis will also be placed on skill development. Government is also implementing special programmes for eradication of poverty and generation of employment. The major poverty alleviation programmes which provide employment in the rural areas are Swarna Jayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana Jawahar Gram Samriddhi Yojana and Employment Assurance Scheme. In the urban areas Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rojgar Yojana (SJSRY) is in operation since 1. 12.97 which also seeks to provide gainful employment to the poor. Prime Minister`s Rozgar Yojana is being implemented as a Central Plan scheme to provide employment opportunities to educated unemployed youths in both rural and urban areas.","minister","ls13","2001","200112","20011210","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2001","15176","94857","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrimunilall","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2001","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2001","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2001","l13_nt_2001","bjp_qna_2001","bjp_nt_2001","other","n200112","l13_qna_200112","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","Labour","awhethertheGovernmenthavelaunchedproposedtolaunchanytimeboundprogrammetoprovideemploymenttoalltheunemployedinthecountryinvariousStatesincludingMadhyaPradeshbifsowhethertheGovernmenthavefixedanytargetinthisregardcifsothedetailsthereofStatewiseanddifnotthereasonstherefor","newdelhi",297

This Ministry has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with UIDAI to partner in the Project related to distribution of PDS Kerosene and domestic Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) using the platform of UIDAI for better targeting of subsidy to the intended beneficiaries. Unique Identification Number (UID) with the Biometric details will help to identify and target the delivery of product only to customer or his family members without any leakages. As per the MOU executed, Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) would act as registrars for the UIDAI on behalf of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas for the implementation of the Project. This would help in accurately identifying users and beneficiaries of the services rendered by the OMCs and have uniform standards and processes for their verification and identification. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, OMCs and UIDAI will chart out a joint road map for the implementation of the AADHAR numbers in the OMCs database. It has been envisaged that with the bio-metric based details, initially distribution of domestic LPG pilot project will be executed along with few State Governments. Based on the experience gained the same will be extended for distribution of PDS Kerosene.","minister","ls15","2010","201012","20101202","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2010","164135","225276","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrijitinprasada","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2010","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2010","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2010","l15_nt_2010","inc_qna_2010","inc_nt_2010","other","n201012","l15_qna_201012","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","PetroleumandNaturalGas","awhetheroilcompanieshaveundertakenaprojectAADHARaimedatcurbingPilferageofkeroseneunderPublicDistributionSystemPDSanddomesticLPGbifsothedetailsthereofcwhethersomeoilcompanieshaveenteredintoaMemorandumofUnderstandingwithUniquieIdentificationAuthoritiyofIndiainthisregardanddifsothedetailsthereof","newdelhi",213

I got your letter.  I am enclosing Badshah Khan’s letter.  If you
can find nobody to take charge of the work at Samau, you cannot
leave the place.  If, however, you think you can do better service in the
Frontier Province, and if you have the courage, you should get ready
to go there and that as early as possible.  Do whatever is proper after
taking into account all factors.  What has happened to Mridulabehn’s
Zohra has gone to Sevagram.
Amtussalaam was in Delhi but is now likely to have gone to
Indore.  Her brother Rashid Khan has expired.
Badshah Khan is with me.  He will stay for some days more.
The work here is not yet over.
I hope you are keeping good health.  Do you find any time to
I have sent our entire family back to Delhi.  Only Rajkumari is
here, for her home is here.

"i660555","t20170209867825","  (a) & (b) The average annual water availability of any region or country is largely dependent upon hydro-meteorological and other factors and is generally constant. As per National Commission on Integrated Water Resources Development (NCIWRD) report, the total water availability of India received through precipitation is about 4000 Billion cubic meter (BCM) per annum. After evaporation, 1869 BCM water is available as natural runoff. Due to topographical and other factors, the utilizable water availability is limited to 1123 BCM per annum, comprising of 690 BCM of surface water and 433 BCM of replenishable ground water. In view of growing population, the per capita water availability in India is reducing progressively. The average annual per capita water availability in the years 2001 and 2011 was assessed as 1820 cubic meters and 1545 cubic meters respectively which may reduce further to 1341 and 1140 in the years 2025 and 2050 respectively. Annual per-capita water availability of less than 1700 cubic meters is considered as water stressed condition, whereas annual per-capita water availability below 1000 cubic meters is considered as a water scarcity condition. Further, total water requirement for irrigation purpose in the country for the years 2025 and 2050 are estimated to be 311 BCM and 807 BCM respectively. River basin being the natural hydrological unit, total water resources availability is assessed river basin wise. The details of the basin-wise average annual water resources availability (or potential) assessed by Central Water Commission in 1993 is at Annexure I. Contd. P2/-   //2//  (c) Water being a State Subject, State Governments undertake several measures for augmenting, conserving and utilizing water resources which inter-alia include conservation of water resources in reservoirs and traditional water bodies, rain water harvesting and artificial recharge of ground water. This Ministry provides technical and financial assistance to the State Governments through various schemes and programmes viz. Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme, Scheme for Repair, Renovation & Restoration of Water-bodies etc. Some of such initiatives taken by Central Government to ensure water security are as follows:  A National Perspective Plan (NPP) envisaging inter-basin transfer of water has been formulated by this Ministry to improve water security in the country. The implementation of NPP would give added benefits of approximately 35 million hectare of additional irrigation potential, 34000 mega watts (MW) hydro power generation, flood moderation, navigation, drinking and industrial water supply, fisheries, salinity and pollution control etc. Central Ground Water Board, under this Ministry has prepared a conceptual document entitled Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water in India during the year 2013 envisaging construction of 1.11 crore Rainwater Harvesting and Artificial Recharge structures in the country to harness 85 BCM (Billion Cubic Meters) of water. The augmented ground water resources will enhance the availability of water for drinking, domestic, industrial and irrigation purposes. The Master Plan has been circulated to all State Governments for implementation. Central Government has launched the National Water Mission with the objective of conservation of water, minimizing wastage and ensuring its more equitable distribution both across and within States through integrated water resources development and management. One of the goals of National Water Mission is increasing water use efficiency by 20%. Improved water use efficiency in different sectors such as in irrigation (through micro-irrigation, e.g., drip, sprinkler etc.), industry and households is being encouraged through various initiatives, programmes/ schemes of the Government. Central Government has launched Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) with the vision of extending the coverage of irrigation Har Khet ko Pani and improving water use efficiency More crop per drop in a focused manner with end to end solution on source creation, distribution, management, field application and extension activities. Water conservation and water harvesting structures to augment ground water constitute a special focus area for MGNREGA works and about 2/3rd of the expenditure is directly related to construction of such structures. Recycle and reuse of water, after treatment to specified standards, rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge are being incentivized through various initiatives, programmes/ schemes of the Government. This Ministry has launched Jal Kranti Abhiyan (2015-16 to 2017-18) in order to consolidate water conservation and management in the country through a holistic and integrated approach involving all stakeholders, making it a mass movement.

"i74489","t20180317678132","The Reverend Shri ShailJagadguruMahaswamiJi, Shri IshwarPanditaradhyaShivachar Swami Ji, Shri Gauri Shankar Shivachar Swami Ji, Shri RenukaShivachar Swami Ji, Shri SugureshwaraShivachar Swami Ji, Shri Doctor RajshekharShivachar Swami Ji, the Reverend Shri Shiv Kumar Swami Ji, Shri Varalinga Swami Ji, saints from all over the country who are present here in Shrishailam, devotees, ladies and gentleman, and my colleague and the most popular leader in Karnataka Shri B. S. YeddyuruppaJi,

First of all my best wishes to all of you for the Ugadi festival. It would have been my good fortunehad I been able to visit Shrishailam, one of the most holy places in the country, in person to receive the blessings of Shri ShailJagad Guru MahaswamiJi and all of you sages and saints. However, due to busy schedule it could not happen. That is why I’m connecting with you people through technology and I offer my deepest regards to you people from here only.

Talking about the significance of Shrishailam, MaharshiVed Vyas had said that the people who visit the shrine get salvation from all kinds of attachments. ShrishailamSamamKshetram Na Bhoota Na Bhavishyati, this sentence aptly describes the superiority of this place.

Not only Mallikarjun Ling, one of the twelve Jyotirlings of India, is located in this region, butBhramrambaShaktipeeth and one of the founding masters of Veer ShaivDharm Shri Jagadguru Surya SinghasanPanditaradhyaGurupeethare also located here. So in this manner, this Shrishailam region is the confluence of the trinity of the Jyotirling, Shaktipeeth and the seat of Jagadguru.

Lord Basveshwara made this place his last resting place in the feet of Lord Shiva. Well known AllamPrabhudev and Akkamahadevi also got united with the Lord in this region only. The place of worship of Shiva devotee Siddha Rameshwar of Solar is also Shri Shailam. HemreddyAllamma became famous because of her devotion to the lord Mallikarjun. This is such a divine place of India which gives its blessing and energy to the entire country.

MahaswamiJi, in this holy place of confluence, an important programme for creating national awareness will be organised here every year on the occasion Ugadi. Thousands of people from across the country, specially from Karnataka will reach there to witness this event by walking hundreds of kilometres on foot. I humbly bow down to every devotee participating in this great Yajna of national awareness and faith.

Ugadi means beginning of a millennium. Ugadi is a festival of beginning of human life, it’s a festival of beginning of the creation. This is a festival of new hopes and aspirations. It’s a festival of nature; it’s a festival of environment. It’s a festival of beginning of a new life.

Tomorrow, people in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and several other states of the country will start the construction of new houses, will purchase new vehicles, new tractors, will start a business or will start some new work in their shops.

I convey my best wishes to everyone celebrating this festival. I wish that they should get plenty of blessings and rewards for their charity through the festival beginning tomorrow.

BevooBela Prasad is a fine example of this thing that how our traditions make us familiar with the principles of life. I’m hopeful that tomorrow all of you will get the taste of BevooBela or UgadiPachadhi. As that Prasadam is little sour, little sweet, life is also like that. Victory and defeat, happiness and misery, these ups and downs of life, how easily these fundamental principles have been made part of our value system, this thing can never be understood by those people who are not familiar with the history of the country.

All of you saints are very well familiar that how many efforts were made to damage our glorious history during the prolonged period of slavery. However, our traditions had that strength that they withstood that assault. So what was that strength in our country, eventually it was who that had held the country together during that period? 

It was the power of sages and saints like you which protected the spiritual and cultural pride of the country at that time.

After the independence, there was some hope that the new government of the country would try to repair whatever little damage was caused to that pride. However, it has been unfortunate the leaders of that period associated the identity of the country with the snake charmers, magic and stunts. Not only this, an effort was made to prevent the future generations from knowing the important things of our glorious past.

This country is indebted to accomplished saints like you that those who tried to manipulate the history did not succeed in their efforts. On the one hand you people protected the country spiritually and culturally and on the other you also carried out the work of strengthening the social systems.

In a way, tomorrow’s event is that occasion of spirituality and knowledge in which whosoever takes a dip will achieve ultimate salvation and success. In a way, these programs and the ancient traditions of Kumbha can be described as of the same kind. During the Kumbha fairs too an effort is made to encompass our massive country at one place. Saints and sages, the wise masters gather and discuss the happiness and misery of the society. There is another unique feature of Kumbha fair. Every 12th year the saints and sages gather on the occasion of Kumbha and then it is decided that now what will be the direction of the society and country for the future. And whatever was decided during that time, in a way, itbecame like the resolutions made by the society.

It’s a matter of pride for all of us that these kind of great traditions which guide the society, which rid the society of its internal vice, have still been working even today. People will come from far flung areas to attend the RashtriyaJan Jagriti Conference organised in Shrishailam, they will meet each other and understand each other. And they will be united as per the spirit of oneness.

Lord Basweshwar had said ‘KarmannevehKarmaniEiziVisheshatShatgum’, it means that living a short life to achieve a defined objective is much better than living for 100 years without having an objective. This thing: to lead a life by having a purpose of life, to understand how to live life by setting an objective has become even more important in modern times.

You people are very well aware that how our government has adopted these words of Lord Basweshwar in our way of working. It has been our effort to formulate every scheme with a well laid out objective and should be implemented in stipulated time.

Today, the impact of this work culture is that more than 31 crore Jan Dhan bank accounts have been opened for poor people in just four years.

Our government has provided the insurance shield to 18 crore poor people at a premium of only one rupee per month and 90 paise per day.

Our government has provided free gas connections to more than three and a half crores women under the Ujjawala scheme in the record time.

More than 1. 25 crore accounts of daughters have been opened under the SukanyaSammriddhiYojana. More than 3 crore kids and more than 80 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinated under the mission Indradhanush.

More than one crore houses have been constructed in the last three years under the Pradhan MantriAvasYojana.

The government has sanctioned more than 11 crore loans without bank guarantee under the Mudra scheme. More than five lakh crore rupees have been disbursed to youth under this scheme.

Today, the speed of constructing roads, the speed of laying the railway tracks and of electrification of tracks or the speed of adding the power capacity have become two-three times faster in comparison with the speed earlier and the reason behind this is the hard work done day-and-night to achieve a set goal.

Recently our government has announced one more scheme. And this scheme will alleviate a very big tension of the life of around 45 to 50 crore people of the country. This scheme is called Ayushman Bharat. The government will provide an insurance cover of up to Rs. five lakh in a year for the treatment of serious diseases to every poor family under the scheme.

Our government has been working towards making the life of poor people of the country, the life of the lower middle class people of the country easier by following the mantra of SabkaSath, SabkaVikas.

Our government has understood the power of people’s movement and given importance to it by learning from the old traditions. And it’s the impact of this thing that today the coverage of sanitation in the country has gone up to 80% under the Clean India Mission. It was around 40% before 2014. It means we have doubled the coverage.

Similarly be it the work of cleaning the rivers or be it Digital India Mission or be it the effort of augmenting the solar power capacity in the country, all these things have been taken forward as people’s movements. Your contribution will work as an inspiration in further strengthening of these people’s movements.

Recently, our government has started a national nutrition programme to tackle the challenge of malnutrition. In this programme, the work has been done as per a new approach.

Providing the nutritious food to women and kids alone does not mean providing nutrition to them.

Our government has been looking at this challenge in a holistic manner. If just nutritious food is provided but if there is an unclean environment around the mother and the kid, if they are not getting vaccination in time, if the proper care has not been given to the mother during the pregnancy and if the child does not get proper time of mother during the initial months then the bad effect of all these things can be seen in the form of malnutrition.

It means there are several conditions that are responsible for malnutrition. And it is also important that these conditions keep changing as per the region. If child marriage is the reason at one place then illiteracy is the reason at some other place. Shortage of food grain might be the reason at some place and at some other place it could belack of vaccination.

Therefore I urge you people that those who participate in the people’s awareness movement atShrishailam should also be given information about this scheme by you people. What are the local conditions there, this issue should be deliberated and the administration should be informed about that. Nutrition is not the subject related only to women, full participation of men is essential for tackling the malnutrition.

Today, the country is passing through a very important phase. The people of the country want to see the country free from its internal vices at the earliest. Your contribution is very important for not only making the people aware and putting an end to evils like casteism but also for putting an end to all the evils like black money and corruption that have been damaging the country. It’s also very important to make people aware about the efforts to divide the society.

The central government has been making every possible effort for the nation building but the blessings of all of you will further boost our energy.

I conclude my speech by once again bowing down to Shri ShailJagadguruMahaswamiJi and all other saints and sages present there.

"i54852","t20100101964194","Draft of the Welcome address of Shri V


Welcome address of Shri V.K.Sharma, Executive Director, RBI for the events 
scheduled to be held in the afternoon on  March 22, 2010 (function organised jointly 
by RBI with Government of Karnataka)   
 
 

On this momentous occasion of the launching of the project on Financial Literacy in 

Karnataka, it is my honour and privilege  to extend a very warm and hearty welcome to 

Respected Dr Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India.  I also extend a hearty welcome 

to Shri S. V. Ranganath, Chief Secretary, Govt. of  Karnataka, Smt. Shyamala Gopinath, 

Smt.Usha Thorat, Dr.K.C.Chakrabarty and Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governors, RBI, 

Principal Secretaries of the Govt. of Karnataka. I also take this opportunity to welcome the 

Chairmen and Managing Directors of all banks, all distinguished invitees and guests, 

Chairman, SLBC, Karnataka, and other senior officials of the State Government, Education 

Department officials, senior officials of banks, Chairmen of Regional Rural Banks, Lead 

District Managers, prize-winning students and their proud parents, other students hailing 

from semi-urban and rural areas and the members of the print &  electronic media.  

 

2. Three important events have been scheduled for this afternoon. These events, which are 

jointly hosted by the Reserve Bank of India and Government of Karnataka, comprise 

release of textbooks containing material on Financial Education in school curriculum, 

distribution of prizes to the winners of the State-wide Quiz Competitions and launching of 

Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) Scheme in Karnataka. 

 

3. The background to this momentous event  was the decision taken, during the meeting of 

the respected Governor with Hon’ble Chief Minister of Karnataka, on May 14, 2009 to 

launch a pilot programme on Financial Literacy in Karnataka in association with the State 

Government. The programme envisaged introducing financial literacy  in the curriculum of 

schools and colleges in the State of Karnataka.  Subsequently, at a high Level meeting 

between Shri Sudhakar Rao, the then Chief Secretary, Government of Karnataka and Smt. 

Usha Thorat, Deputy Governor, RBI, it was decided that revision of syllabus and content of 

textbooks for classes V, VII, VIII and IX would be carried out for the academic year 2010-

11. Accordingly, the  content for the proposed curriculum change was developed by RBI 



and formally handed over by the Reserve Bank Governor to the Chief Secretary, 

Government of Karnataka on September 22, 2009 during the Outreach Programme 

organized  in Doddabelavangala village in Bengaluru Rural district. I am happy to inform 

you that the textbooks incorporating the content provided by RBI have since been printed 

and made available by the Government of Karnataka.  
4. Another significant decision taken during the meeting of the respected Governor with the 

Hon’ble Chief Minister of Karnataka on May 14, 2009 was that steps would be taken to 

make Financial Literacy part of non-formal education. As a follow up to this decision,  State-

wide Quiz competitions covering the schools, and PU colleges in all the blocks and districts 

of the State,  were held  in association with Government of Karnataka, SLBC and the Lead 

Banks. The literature developed by RBI under ‘Raju and Money Kumar’ series and other 

material prepared on features of genuine currency notes, etc. were used for conduct of the 

Quiz competitions in both English and Kannada. RBI, Bangalore, printed around 8.80 lakh 

booklets for distribution to the targeted schools/colleges through the Lead District 

Managers and Deputy Directors of the Education Department. The block and district level 

Quiz competitions culminated in the State Level Quiz Competitions. I am pleased to inform 

this august  audience that distinguished dignitaries sitting on the dais will give away the 

prizes to the winners of the State Level Quiz Competition. 

 

5. Finally, I would like to say a few words about Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT)  Scheme 

which is formally being launched today by Chief Secretary,  Shri S.V. Ranganath.  This was 
a sequel to Governor’s meeting with senior officials of the State Government, commercial 

banks and financial institutions represented in Karnataka on May 14, 2009, where it was 

decided that all issues relating to implementation shall be resolved to facilitate its 

implementation in the State. Accordingly, steps were taken to implement the scheme as a 

pilot in Bellary, Chitradurga and Gulbarga districts under ‘One district-multiple banks’ model 

for routing payments through ‘no frills’ accounts, or other bank accounts, under Mahatma 

Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Programme and Social Security Pensions schemes. 

Such account-holders will be issued biometric smart cards with individual IDs.  Later on, the 

Government of Karnataka identified three other districts viz. Chamarajanagar, Mandya and 

Dharwad for implementation of the scheme under ‘One district- one bank’ model. This 

 2



entire initiative is being planned and executed in co-ordination with the State Government, 

SLBC and the respective Lead banks of the above six districts.  

 

6.  I am sure that today’s momentous and landmark event would be a watershed in the 

march of the State of Karnataka towards financial inclusion and inclusive growth and 

sustainable prosperity and going forward would pave the way for its replication across the 

entire country. 

7.  I once again extend my warm welcome to all the dignitaries.  My special welcome to the 

young students whose participation would undoubtedly make today’s programme more 

lively, vibrant and enriching. 

 

Thank you all so very much indeed!

"i424961","t20010807364513","  (a) China is not a member of the World Trade Organisation. The Recife Declaration of the E-9 Countries in which both China and India are members inter-alia acknowledge the crucial role of national governments in partnership with provincial governments local bodies non-governmental organisations and civil society in meeting the goals of Education for All.(b) (c) & (d) The National Policy on Education (NPE) 1986 as revised in 1992 encourages non-government and voluntary effort including social activist groups to promote education subject to proper management. It also recommends suitable steps to prevent the establishment of institutions set up to commercialise education. Accordingly State Governments have their own regulatory laws to regulate different aspects of education at various levels including matters like admissions fee structure recruitment of teachers management of institutions transaction of curriculum setting up of new institutions etc. At the Central level University Grants Commission (UGC) All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) have been set up as statutory bodies to ensure proper maintenance of norms and standards in higher technical and management education and teacher education respectively. All these organisations have laid down detailed norms rules and regulations in their respective field of education. The Government therefore while in favour of public-private partnership in education would not agree that this would necessarily lead to commercialisation of education. The partnership would provide for greater access to higher education at the same time promoting up-gradation in quality. Education is integrally linked with national development where partnership with the private sector would also need to be encouraged so as to optimise financial physical and intellectual resources. This is all the more so in the context of the evolving educational scenario.","minister","ls13","2001","200108","20010807","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2001","49654","87266","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","drmurlimanoharjoshi","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2001","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2001","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2001","l13_nt_2001","bjp_qna_2001","bjp_nt_2001","other","n200108","l13_qna_200108","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","HumanResourceDevelopment","awhetherIndiaandChinahavemutuallydecidedtoopposecommercialisationofeducationatalltheforumsincludingtheWorldTradeOrganizationbifsotheilleffectslikelytobesufferedbythesocietyasaresultofcommercialisationofeducationcwhetherallowingforforeigncapitalinvestmentandprivatisationinhighereducationsysteminthecountrylikelytoaddtocommercialisationofeducationanddifsothereactionoftheGovernmenttheretoandthestepsproposedtobetakeninthisregard","newdelhi",292

"i518086","t20070823520162","  (a) Yes, Sir.(b) & (c) The total annual requirement of wheels of Indian Railways is approximately 2,40,000 nos. The manufacturing capacity of the two indigenous sources i.e. Rail Wheel Factory, Bangalore and Steel Authority of India (Durgapur Steel Plant) put together is about 2,00,000 wheels. Wheels for high horse power locomotives and high speed coaches etc.for which requirements are small are also imported since economies of scale do not permit indigenous production. However, indigenous development of these wheels has been taken up and such production will be concurrent with the growth in volumes. The reasons for import of wheels are therefore shortage of capacity and requirement of special type of wheels. A statement showing the details of import of wheels during the year 2006-07 is attached.(d) & (e) A new wheel manufacturing factory in Chhapra, Bihar, has also been sanctioned and the project is planned to be completed by January 2010. This shall supplement the production capacity available in the country from Rail Wheel Factory, Bangalore and Durgapur Steel Plant.

"i655553","t20161125460120","a) to (c): Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has reported that it has advised all State Cooperative Banks (StCBs) and District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs), vide circular dated 21 July, 2014, to maintain 100% of their Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) in the form of approved securities in a phased manner by March 31, 2017. As per RBIs guidelines, these banks have been given the time frame of three years to shift their entire SLR to approved securities, as under: Date Investment in approved securities as percentage of Net Demand & Time Liabilities (NDTL) as on July 25, 2014 March 31, 2015 5% March 31, 2016 10% March 31, 2017 Entire SLR as may be prescribed by RBI on that date  RBI has informed that the above guidelines have been carefully calibrated so that the banks can plan phasing out of their fixed/term deposits and commence investment in approved securities. The above roadmap will enable StCBs to meet the demand for withdrawal of term deposits by DCCBs without impacting their liquidity in the near term. RBI has further informed that the SLR for non-scheduled StCBs and DCCBs has been brought down from the level of 25% of Net Demand & Time Liabilities (NDTL) in June 2014 to 20.75% in October 2016 and it will further brought down to 20.50% from January 2017. These reductions will augment the liquid funds available with the banks to facilitate lending operations and therefore the income of these banks will not be negatively impacted.","minister","ls16","2016","201611","20161125","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2016","219774","317866","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2016","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2016","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2016","l16_nt_2016","bjp_qna_2016","bjp_nt_2016","other","n201611","l16_qna_201611","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","Finance","awhethertheReserveBankofIndiaRBIhasmadeitmandatoryfortheDistrictCooperativeBankstoparktheamountofStatutoryLiquidityRatioSLRinGovernmentandtrusteesecuritieswhichislikelytoreducetheassetsofthesebanksandcannegativelyimpacttheirincomebifsothedetailsthereofStateCooperativeBankwiseincludingMadhyaPradeshandcwhetherthesaiddecisionoftheRBIisadverselyaffectingthefarmersofthecountryparticularlyMadhyaPradeshifsotheactiontakenbytheGovernmenttogetexemptionfromthesaidinstructions","newdelhi",250

"i429015","t20011119104085","  (a) to (h) A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (h) OF REPLY TO THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.1 BY SHRIMATI RENU KUMARI AND SHRI RAVINDRA KUMAR PANDEY REGARDING `CULTIVATION OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED BT COTTON VARIANT CROP` DUE FOR REPLY ON 19-11-2001 (a) to (h) The Government has not yet given approval for commercial cultivation of genetically modified Bt cotton in the country. In June 2001 the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) set up under Rule 4 of the Rules for Manufacture Use Import Export and storage of hazardous microorganisms/Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells 1989` notified under the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 has directed the Maharashtra Hybrid Seed Company (MAHYCO) to repeat large scale field trials of its three Bt cotton hybrids (MECH 12 MECH 162 MECH 184) on farmers fields in an area of about 100 hectares in the states of Andhra Pradesh Karnataka Gujarat Maharashtra Madhya Pradesh and Tamilnadu. In addition the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) is also conducting field trials of MAHYCO`s Bt cotton under their Advanced Varietal Trials of All India Coordinated Cotton Improvement Project. ICAR is conducting these trials in about 7.5 hectares in Maharashtra Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat in the central zone and Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Tamilnadu in the southern zone. In September 2001 it was brought to the notice of the Government that Navbharat Seeds Pvt. Ltd. Ahmedabad has marketed hybrid cotton seed by brand name Navbharat 151 as a conventionally developed hybrid which is tolerant to bollworm. Tests conducted on seeds from a sealed packet of Navbharat 151 as well as on the spot inspection of six fields near Ahmedabad where this hybrid is under cultivation indicated that Navbharat 151 contains Cry 1 A ( c) gene which goes to establish that it is a transgenic variety and not a conventional hybrid. The 1989 Rules provide that approvals for any large scale releases into the environment including any deliberate release into environment for the purpose experiment of transgenic organisms are to be given by the GEAC. The company has marketed the Navbharat 151 transgenic hybrid without the mandatory approval of the GEAC. In Gujarat nearly 11 000 acres is under cultivation of Navbharat 151 variety in 19 districts namely Kheda Surat Baroda Ahmedabad Junagarh Amreli Surindernagar Kachchh Jamnagar Rajkot Bhavnagar Banaskantha Mehasana Patan Anand Gandhinagar Sabarkantha Baruch and Narmada. It has also marketed a small quantity of Navbharat 151 seeds in Maharashtra Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. In addition this company is undertaking seed production of transgenic cotton in 365 hectares in Nandyal and Kurnool districts of Andhra Pradesh. Since the crop has not been harvested the exact production figures are not known. For the last five years MAHYCO has been involved in research development and testing of transgenic Bt cotton after carefully following the procedures stipulated under the 1989 Rules for evaluating the environmental risks. MAHYCO approached the GEAC for seeking environmental clearance for commercial cultivation of transgenic Bt cotton in June 2001. However GEAC directed the MAHYCO to repeat the field trials considering that the field trials conducted earlier could not properly evaluate the potential of the Bt cotton. Being the first transgenic crop to be considered for commercial cultivation in India the GEAC adopted a cautious and pragmatic approach to get a better picture about the potential advantages and environmental effects of Bt Cotton. The large scale field trials of MAHYCO`s Bt cotton are presently underway. Navbharat Seeds Pvt Ltd has marketed transgenic Bt cotton seeds without any biosafety assessment as laid down in the 1989 Rules thereby violating the provisions of these Rules and the Environment Protection Act. The GEAC has directed the Gujarat State Biotechnology Coordination Committee to:  - procure the cotton bolls of Navbharat 151 crop from the farmers at the appropriate  support price; - separate the lint and seed; - destroy the seed and store the lint in safe custody till further orders from GEAC ; - complete destruction of crop residue by uprooting and burning and sanitation of fields. To carry out the operations the Government of Gujarat has tied up with the Gujarat Cooperative Cotton Federation (GUJCOT). The Government of Andhra Pradesh has been directed to take necessary action for stopping immediately the transgenic seed production and multiplication programme of the Navbharat Company on the lines of the directives given to the Government of Gujarat. The States of Maharashtra M. P. Karnataka Chattisgarh Tamil Nadu Punjab and Haryana have been asked to gather information about cultivation of Navbharat 151 cotton seeds in their respective States. The Government has also lodged a complaint against the Navbharat Company in the Metropolitan Magistrate Court in Ahmedabad on 12. 11.2001 for penal action for violating Environment Protection Act. The Government has directed the Gujarat Government to procure the cotton at appropriate support price so that the farmers are not adversely affected. The Government is following a policy of case by case approval of transgenic crops. Introduction of any new technology requires careful evaluation and long term sustainable benefits. Environmental problems have long term implications. Unless a cautious approach is adopted gains accrued out of this new technology may be short lived and may end up in irreversible damage. Extensive Rules and guidelines have been framed for evaluating environmental and health safety aspects of genetically modified organisms. Any company involved in the use of genetic engineering techniques has to obtain approval of the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM) set up under the 1989 Rules in the Department of Biotechnology for conducting testing under laboratory conditions and confined field conditions. Thereafter approval of GEAC is required for large scale field trials and introduction into the environment.","minister","ls13","2001","200111","20011119","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2001","13522","91320","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shritrbaalu","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2001","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2001","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2001","l13_nt_2001","bjp_qna_2001","bjp_nt_2001","other","n200111","l13_qna_200111","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","EnvironmentandForests","awhethergeneticallymodifiedBtcottonvariantcrophasbeengrownindifferentpartsofthecountrybifsothenameofStateswheresuchcropshavebeengrownalongwiththetotalproductionandtheareacoveredthereundercwhethertheGovernmenthavegivenapprovalforthecultivationofBtcottondifnotthereasonsthereforandtheactiontakenproposedtobetakenagainsttheoffendersforprovidingsuchseedstothefarmersewhethertheGeneticEngineeringApprovalCommitteeGEAChasdirectedtheconcernedStatestoprocurestandingcottoncropfromfarmersforburningitfifsothedetailsthereofandthereasonstherefortogetherwiththereactionofthevariousStatestosuchdirectivesgthestepstakenbytheGovernmenttorehabilitatethefarmerswhoarelikelytobeaffectedandhthedetailsofthepolicyoftheGovernmentinregardtothecultivationofgeneticallymodifiedBtcottonvariantcrop","newdelhi",957

Rural drinking water supply is a State subject. However, for improving the coverage of safe drinking water to rural population, this Ministry supplements the efforts of the States by providing them with technical and financial assistance through the centrally sponsored scheme National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP). It is the State Government who plan, design, approve, execute and operate & maintain the schemes for providing safe drinking water to rural population. The funds provided to the States under NRDWP can be utilized for coverage and tackling water quality problems with priority to fluoride and arsenic affected habitations. The Ministry has informed all the States to commission surface water based piped water supply schemes in all water quality affected habitations as a long term sustainable solution. To deal with arsenic and fluoride contamination, with the recommendation of NITI Aayog, Government of India had released Rs.1,000 crore in March 2016 for commissioning of Community Water Purification Plants (CWPPs) and surface water based piped water supply schemes. In addition to this, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation had launched the National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM) on 22nd March, 2017, under NRDWP to provide safe drinking water to about 28,000 arsenic / fluoride affected habitations, in a span of 4 years, subject to availability of funds.","minister","ls16","2018","201804","20180405","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2018","263926","343177","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrissahluwalia","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2018","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2018","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2018","l16_nt_2018","bjp_qna_2018","bjp_nt_2018","other","n201804","l16_qna_201804","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","DrinkingWaterandSanitation","athenamesofStateswherearsenicandotherharmfulsubstancesarefoundingroundwaterusedbyhabitantsfordrinkingpurposesbthemeasuresprojectstakentoimprovethepoorqualityofundergroundwaterforitsuseasdrinkingwaterinruralareasandctheotherstepsbeingtakenbyherMinistrytoensurecontinuedavailabilityandaccesstocleandrinkingwaterinruralareasacrossthecountryincludingdroughthitStates","newdelhi",264

The rent ceilings of such godowns were fixed @40 paise and 50 paise per sq.ft.per month in Rural/Urban areas After expiry of its guarantee period all these godowns came under general hiring and the rents were fixed by the competent authority as per guidelines of Headquarters issued from time to time.

However Zonal Mangers of FCI have been delegated with full powers to decide the rentals of covered godowns of the private parties beyond the ceiling rates whereas for CAP (Plinths) storage these ceiling rates are maximum. Storage charges that are payable to CWC include weighment charges preservation establishment charges and all other operations and hence are not comparable with the private capacities being hired and managed by FCI. The existing rate for CWC is Rs. 2.10 per bag (95 Kg.) per month for covered godowns.

"i4644","t19160104980153","I have come here to see an old friend of mine. Hindus and
Muslims should become united; that is the desire I have expressed at
every place. I hope both these communities will help me. When I
started from Kathor in a small bullock-cart; I was in a hurry and as I
wished, for the sake of my personal convenience, to reach here early, I
did not mind when bullocks were struck with a goad. Hinduism,
however, teaches us that we should not hurt cows and bullocks. The
sacred book of Islam stresses the importance of compassion. I felt that
it was cruel to strike bullocks with a goad. In England, this is a
punishable offence, but here no action is taken in the matter. The
scriptures of both the religions lay down that we should not inflict
cruelty on even the meanest of creatures. I also will have to answer for
this in the court of the Almighty. When I come here again, it will
make me happy to see that the sticks are no longer spiked. If I do not
find that you have done so., I shall prefer going on foot rather than in
the bullock-cart. We should not strike animals which happen to be
weak. Let us remember that if any person strikes us, we abuse him.
Finally, I thank you for the kindness shown to me.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has reported that the success of rural Self Help Groups (SHGs) poverty alleviation and empioyment generation programmes under Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY) scheme does depend on the cooperation of the banks. As per the guidelines of the SGSY scheme credit is the major element of the Scheme. The banks are closely associated and involved in preparing the project reports for the key activities identified under the scheme so as to avoid delays in sanctioning of loans and to ensure edequacy of financing and also in identification and selection of Swarozgaris.(c) and (d) It is not true that banks are not co-operating in the implementation of Government sponsored schemes. However whenever some complaints relating to procedural delay in sanction and disbursement of loans are received remedial action is taken to rectify the complaint. RBI has issued instructions prescribing a time frame within which cases are required to be disposed off. Progress under the scheme is regularly reviewed and is discussed in fora like State Level Bankers Committee District Level Regional Committee etc.and the concerned Lead Banks are advised to take all efforts for the smooth implementation of the various Poverty Alleviation Programmes. Banks are also advised to sanction and dispose off the applications within the prescribed time period so as io minimize the gap between sanction and disbursements.","minister","ls13","2001","200108","20010824","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2001","50211","89930","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shribalasahebvikhepatil","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2001","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2001","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2001","l13_nt_2001","bjp_qna_2001","bjp_nt_2001","other","n200108","l13_qna_200108","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","Finance","awhetherthesuccessofthefunctioningoftheruralselfhelpgroupspovertyalleviationprogrammeandemploymentgenerationprogrammeSwarnajayantiGramSwarojgarYojanaSGSYdependsonthecooperationofbanksbifsothepositioninthisregardcwhetherithascometothenoticeoftheGovernmentthatthebanksarenotcooperationinthismatterandtheapplicantsreceivedpendingforloanundertheschemearebeingharassedanddthedetailsoftheremedyproposedtobetakenbytheGovernmentinthisregard","newdelhi",232

"i5228","t19180412495240","CHI. DEVDAS,

I have your letter. I also wrote one to you, which you must have
received. You have said nothing about your health. I am greatly
pleased to learn that you have been attending on nursing the sister. We
read in our holy books that pupils used to volunteer their services to
their teachers. Your way of putting the thing is as natural and sweet as
in those books. I do not know how to measure the height to which this
service will raise you.

It is quite easy to understand why I did not ask for 35 per cent
[increase] for more than one day. It was impossible for me
to stretch the matter any further. The employers even now think that
they agreed to give so much not because of any firmness on the
workers’ part but on account of my fast. I would have been guilty of
a kind of violence if I had asked for more. In accepting the minimum
when I was in a position to ask for more, I showed straight forwardness,
modesty and good sense. Had I not fasted, it is certain that the
workers would have yielded. They kept firm because of the fast. A
pledge so kept [by the workers] can justify only a demand placed at
the lowest. We can have it respected merely in the letter. This one was
so respected and, because I placed the demand at the minimum, I
made up in a way, indeed in great measure, for the flaws which had
tainted my fast. Esther understood the significance of the fast very
clearly. She wired me a sentence from the Bible. It means:
Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his
friends.1
I look upon that fast as the best thing I have done so far. The
peace which I knew at the time of that fast was no mere human
experience.

I do not get here the joy which I found in my work at
Ahmedabad. I feel uneasy in mind and keep thinking of all manner
of things. Sometimes, I feel people have understood the idea all right;
at other times, I fancy that they have not understood it and so feel
pained. To be sure, excellent work is being done, but now the mind is
fatigued. It is a crushing burden I carry, that of the fight for
Mohammed Ali. I have no choice but to bear it. I cherish the hope
that God will give me the strength for it and, because of that hope, I
am calm in the inmost depths of my heart. Ba is with me.

Tell Chhotalal that his pen appears to have grown stale again.

no attempt at all to understand the currency problem.4 I live from

"i25221","t19340617634613","BOARD, BOMBAY
After his consultation1 Gandhiji addressed the Board in a speech which  is
described as one of the most moving and earnest speeches that he has ever delivered.
The main trend of the speech was that the Congress claimed to stand for the Muslims
as well as the Hindus and the Sikhs and  other communities and that,  therefore,
nothing should be done that would have the effect of making the Muslims feel that the
Congress had departed from that position.
The majority of the Muslims had accepted the Communal Award. It was their
duty to bring about such a voluntary settlement of the Communal Award as would
satisfy all communities. They should not go to a third party to secure a modification
of the Award. So long, however, as a voluntary settlement was not brought about, it
would be betrayal of the Muslims to shake their confidence in the Congress by taking
up a position of uncompromising opposition to their view of the Communal Award.

"i13784","t19280722767242","MY RELATIONS WITH BARDOLI
There is no need for me to explain to the readers of Navajivan
my connection with the Bardoli struggle. But it has become necessary
to state it clearly because a dangerous rumour has been spread lately.
Let it be known to the readers that I have associated myself with the
Bardoli  Satyagraha  from  its  very  beginning.  Its  leader  is  Shri
Vallabhbhai and he can take me to Bardoli whenever he needs me.
Not  that  he  needs  my  advice;  but,  while  taking  any  important
decisions, he consults me. He does all the work whether small or big
on his own responsibility. I do not go to attend the meetings, etc., But
this is an understanding reached between him and me before the
struggle began. My health does not permit me to carry on all kinds of
activities. That is why he has taken a vow not to take me anywhere in
Ahmedabad or elsewhere in Gujarat without sufficient justification,
and he has kept this vow to the letter. I have full sympathy with all the
steps undertaken in the struggle. I have full sympathy with the steps
that may be taken by Vallabhbhai in the dangerous situation which
may possibly arise now. And if he is arrested, I am fully prepared to
go to Bardoli. Neither he nor I have seen any need for me to go to
Bardoli or take any active part so long as he is there. Where complete
mutual trust exists, there is no room for outward show or politeness.
THE INFLUENCE OF THE SPINNING-WHEEL
Bhai Fulchand, the soul of the Wadhwan Rashtriya Educational
Society, has been in the Bardoli struggle right from the beginning. He
is at present working in Vedchhi. He writes from there:1
Those who have no faith in the spinning-wheel may question the
claim that Bhai Fulchand has made for the spinning-wheel and say
that the same result can be achieved by any other kind of industry.
Although  it  is  true  that  a  good  deed  produces  good  results,
nevertheless, there is always some difference between one type of
industry and another. Some occupations build up a man’s physique,
others strengthen the mind, yet others bring peace, while some make
him restless. I have already quoted the opinion of an experienced
teacher of Scotland that working on the spinning wheel is such an
occupation that, if a restless and unsteady person  takes  to  it, he
becomes peaceful and steady. A fiery-tempered person will be able to
give up anger. Moreover, the nature of the sentiments underlying an
activity determines the qualities which it generates. If the activity of
the spinning-wheel is carried on by a saintly couple and if they make
the spinning wheel the means for spreading the spirit of saintliness
amongst the people, this quality would then be visible in this activity.
The advantages of the spinning-wheel which are seen in Vedchhi may
not be seen everywhere. Hence it can be said that the fearlessness and
frankness which Bhai Fulchand notices around Vedchhi owe their
existence not to the spinning-wheel, but to Bhai Chunilal and his wife.
They have spun their good qualities around the spinning-wheel. It can
certainly be claimed that they were able to spread these qualities
through the spinning-wheel with much greater ease than they could
have done through any other means.
The same is true of the Bhajan Mandali. Through a Bhajan
Mandali, fraud can be spread, and such a Bhajan Mandali can also be
an everlasting medium for the spread of purity. There is no doubt that
the Mandali has played an important role in the Bardoli struggle, and
the root of these two activities is in religion. If the Bardoli struggle
had not been carried on through the medium of religious sentiment,
the success that it has achieved today would never have been gained.
propaganda done by the Bhajan Mandali  for  khadi, prohibition  and other good
causes.
Consciously or unconsciously people crave for religion. They saw
religion in satyagraha and in the commander  of  the  satyagrahis;
hence, they followed him and we can see signs that they will do so to
the end.","histfigures","gandhi","1928","192807","19280722","preindependence","na","iim1","selfpolitics","column","na","na","na","india","na","ahmedabad","na","english","mynotes","httpswwwgandhiashramsevagramorggandhiliteraturecollectedworksofmahatmgandhivolume1to98php","mkg1928","13785","19308","notrans","saksham","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","gandhi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","hist","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","mkg_col","na","yes","others","m","inc","mkg_se","mkg_iim1","inc_col","inc_se","inc_iim1","m_col","m_se","m_iim1","his1928","his_col","his_se","his_iim1","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","mkg","his","others","mkg","his","others","mkg","his","others","mkg","his","others","mkg_col","his_col","o_col","mkg_se","his_se","o_se","mkg_iim1","his_iim1","o_iim1","mint","clean","plib","english","gandhi","mkg","se","col","na","inc_mkg","inc_col","inc_iim1","inc_se","plib_mkg","plib_col","plib_iim1","plib_se","plib_inc","plib1928","plib_inc_col","mkg_col_1928","mkg_se_1928","inc_col_1928","inc_se_1928","other","n192807","mkg_col_192807","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_se","his_col","his_se","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_c","mkg_c","mkg_c","mkg_c","Gc","Gc","Gc","Gc",NA,NA,NA,702

"i9533","t19250607661549","From the letters I receive from Kathiawar I find that those who
had undertaken to enlist farmers and members of poor classes who
would spin by hand seem to have succeeded. Devchandbhai1 is very
hopeful about this. It seems the workers are succeeding in finding
such families without much effort. Devchandbhai believes that many
more families would come forward [for spinning] if we had more
workers and were in a position to supply more slivers at half price. But
the question is whether it would be better to serve the families we have
already enlisted or to welcome more families than we had provided
for and meet their needs. Serving these families means strengthening
the intermediate agencies, improving the spinning-wheel and helping
the families to improve the quality of spinning and teaching them
carding, etc. I cannot offer, and hold that I have no right to offer, any
advice from this distance. I consider it dangerous to give advice
without regard to the changing circumstances. I, therefore, wish to
place before the workers my experiences in Bengal. I find here that
hardly at any place do they supply slivers [to the spinners]. In fact
they are supplied nowhere except in Calcutta, instead they supply only
cotton. Thousands of women-spinners ask only for cotton, which they
gin with their own hands. Those who know anything about spinning
will see that persons who do the ginning and carding themselves
naturally earn more. Anyone who has done these things will know that
it is not difficult to attend to all these processes at home. In Bengal
people have still not forgotten the old days and, therefore, they readily
respond to these ideas. No one can surpass the slivers available in
Bengal. One will never find any particle in them. Even if everyone
who spins cannot do ginning in his home, why cannot he do carding?
The carding instruments here are very simple and hardly cost four to
six annas. They moisten a bamboo rod and bend it, and in many cases
make the bowstring out of banana fibre. The striker, of course, they
never use. Instead, they work with a finger. We may not go so far, it
may not even be necessary to do so. But it is certainly necessary for
those who are regular spinners to learn carding forthwith. I think it
will be difficult to go on supplying slivers for ever. Another thing I
observed here is that hardly anyone spins yarn of less than ten counts.
The yarn available in the market is mostly of more than ten counts.

Leaving out devkapas, the cotton here is of an inferior quality to that
of our mathia. The implements used on this side are cheaper than
ours. I wonder if cheap instruments do no ultimately prove costly.

State-wise, NGO-wise, details for the last three years are available in the Annual Report 2008-09 of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.(c) & (d) : Review of the performance of the tribal welfare programme is a continuous process and is carried out through periodic field visits, regular interactions with the State Governments, annual inspections, furnishing of periodic progress reports and utilization certificates by the implementing agencies.(e) The Tribal Sub Plan strategy adopted since the Fifth Five Year Plan continues to operate till date, in order to bring about speedy socio-economic development among tribals, including the poor. Under this, the States are expected to provide funds which are at least equal to the percentage of tribal population to the total population in the States. In addition, the Central Government provides Special Central Assistance to TSP, as an additive to the States to bring about, more rapid economic development of tribals living below the poverty line. In pursuance of the Constitutional obligations, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs provides grants under Article 275 (1) of the Constitution to all ST populated States, with the objective of promoting the welfare of STs (primarily through bridging critical infrastructure gaps) or raising the level of administration of Scheduled Areas. Apart from providing institutional finance for schemes/projects aimed at ameliorating the condition of poor tribals, funds for tribal development are also sourced from various programmes of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs as well as the sectoral programmes of Central Ministries / Departments.","minister","ls15","2009","200912","20091211","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2009","212044","206455","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","drtusharachaudhary","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2009","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2009","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2009","l15_nt_2009","inc_qna_2009","inc_nt_2009","other","n200912","l15_qna_200912","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","TribalAffairs","athedetailsofthedevelopmentalprogrammesundertakenforthewelfareoftribalsbthefinancialassistancereleasedtovariousCentralMinistriesStateGovernmentsNonGovernmentalOrganisationsetcforamelioratingtheconditionofTribalsagencywiseforthelastthreeyearsandcurrentyearcwhethertheGovernmenthasassessedreviewedtheperformanceoftribalwelfareprogrammesdifsothedetailsthereofandewhetheranyspecificstrategyhasbeenchalkedouttobringaboutspeedydevelopmentamongpoortribals","newdelhi",309

I have your letter. The receipt for the contribution towards
cow-protection work is enclosed. The names of the contributors have
already been published in Navajivan. I was happy to learn about the
conditions there. It would be very good if we could persuade people
to take up spinning again.

If anything has been published about standards in national
schools, I shall send you the literature. I shall also send you the list of
text-books if any such list has been prepared. People should learn to
make slivers there. Bhagavanji knows the process very well. You may
take his help. If you cannot get there khadi made from hand-spun

I have your letter for which I thank you.

With reference to the boy who is suffering from tuberculosis, if
he is old enough to judge for himself, I think he should use his own
discretion and take whatever he considers is not objectionable from
the religious standpoint. If, however, he is too young to decide for
himself, it is proper for him to submit to his father’s wishes.

Yours sincerely,

"i689866","t20190103564113","  (a) to (d) The average annual water availability of any region or country is largely dependent upon hydro-meteorological and geological factors and is generally constant. However, water availability per person is dependent on population of the country and for India, per capita water availability in the country is reducing progressively due to increase in population. The average annual per capita water availability in the years 2001 and 2011 was assessed as 1816 cubic meters and 1545 cubic meters respectively which may reduce further to 1340 and 1140 in the years 2025 and 2050 respectively. Annual per-capita water availability of less than 1700 cubic meters is considered as water stressed condition, whereas annual per-capita water availability below 1000 cubic meters is considered as a water scarcity condition. Due to high temporal and spatial variation of precipitation, the water availability of many regions of the country is much below the national average and can be considered as water stressed / water scarce. The average annual water potential in the country has been assessed as 1869 Billion Cubic Meters (BCM). Due to topographical and other factors, the utilizable water availability is limited to 1137 BCM per annum, comprising of 690 BCM of surface water and 447 BCM of replenishable ground water. Further, National Commission on Integrated Water Resources ContdP/2 //2// Development (NCIWRD) have mentioned in their report that taking into account the water availability and the requirements in India, which has been assessed as 843 BCM in the year 2025 and 1180 BCM in 2050, there is no need to take an alarmist view. The report titled Composite Water Management Index published by NITI Aayog referred to estimates of the Global Health Observatory Data Repository of World Health Organization which states that nearly 2 lakh people die every year due to inadequate/unsafe water in India.(e) Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources including tackling of water crisis are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes. Central Government has taken various steps to tackle water crisis in the country. Central Government has formulated a National Perspective Plan (NPP) for Water Resources Development which envisages transfer of water from water surplus basins to water deficit basins to improve availability of water. Central Government has launched Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) in 2015-16 which aims to enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices, etc. During 2016-17, 99 on-going Major/Medium irrigation projects under PMKSY-Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh hectares have been prioritized in consultation with States, for completion in phases up to December, 2019.

DEAR SIR,

You are reported to have made the following observations
regarding the Asiatic Act:
The Law, said Mr. Neser, regarding Asiatics was highly necessary.
He could not understand the objections raised by the Indians with regard to the
taking of fingerprints, in which there was nothing degrading whatever, and
the only reason he could see was that the Indians were endeavouring to shield
those of their fraternity who had come and were still coming into the
Transvaal in an illegal way.
My Association regrets that you have not taken the trouble to
understand the objections of the Indian community to the Asiatic Act.
I beg to invite your attention to the letter addressed by my Association
to General Botha,1 and to add that, in the opinion of my Association,

the Act not only wounds every manly sentiment but it insults the great
religions of India.

My Association is surprised that you should consider it fit to
charge the community represented by my Association with a desire to
shield those who have entered the Colony illegally. I am sure you do
not consider that British Indians are ready to sacrifice all that they
hold dear forthe sake of covering the guilty. Moreover, the fact that
British Indians have accepted the principle of voluntary registration
shows that it is not possible for the Indian community to screen
offenders.

[I have, etc.,

ESSOP ISMAIL MIA,

"i46096","t19481207901609","Well, the view that I take is this, that clause (3) is really unnecessary. It relates to a school maintained by a community. After school hours, the community may be free to make use of it as it likes. There ought to be no provision at all in the Constitution. Now, Sir, there is one other point to which I would like to make reference and that is the point made by Prof. K. T. Shah that the proviso permits the State to continue to give religious instruction in institutions the trusteeship of which the State has accepted. I do not think really that there is much substance in the point raised by Prof. Shah. I think he will realise that there have been cases where institutions in the early part of the history of this country have been established with the object of giving religious instruction and for some reason they were unable to have people to manage them and they were taken over by the State as a trustee for them. Now, it is obvious that when you accept a trust you must fulfil that trust in all respects. If the State has already taken over these institutions and placed itself in the position of trustee, then obviously you cannot say to the Government that notwithstanding the fact that you were giving religious instruction in these institutions, hereafter you shall not give such instruction. I think that would be not only permitting the State but forcing it to commit a breach of trust. In order therefore to have the situation clear, we thought it was desirable and necessary to introduce the proviso, which to some extent undoubtedly is not in consonance with the original proposition contained in sub-clause (1) of article 20. I hope, Sir, the House will find that the article as it now stands is satisfactory and may be accepted.","histfigures","ambedkar","1948","194812","19481207","postindependence","na","inc00","nationalpol","debate","na","na","na","india","ncr","newnewdelhi","capital","english","clausewisediscussionarticle22","httpdrambedkarwritingsgovinuploaduploadfilesfilesvolume_13pdf","bra1948","1043","51641","notrans","surabh","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","ambedkar","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","hist","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","bra_deb","na","yes","others","m","aiscf","bra_nt","bra_inc00","aiscf_deb","aiscf_nt","aiscf_inc00","m_deb","m_nt","m_inc00","his1948","his_deb","his_nt","his_inc00","bra","bra","bra","bra","bra","bra","bra","bra","bra","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","bra","his","others","bra","his","others","bra","his","others","bra","his","others","bra_deb","his_deb","o_deb","bra_nt","his_nt","o_nt","bra_inc00","his_inc00","o_inc00","mint","clean","plib","english","ambedkar","bra","nt","deb","na","aiscf_bra","aiscf_deb","aiscf_inc00","aiscf_nt","plib_bra","plib_deb","plib_inc00","plib_nt","plib_aiscf","plib1948","plib_aiscf_deb","bra_deb_1948","bra_nt_1948","aiscf_deb_1948","aiscf_nt_1948","other","n194812","bra_deb_194812","bra_deb","bra_deb","bra_deb","bra_nt","his_deb","his_nt","bra_deb","bra_deb","bra_deb","bra_deb","bra_j","bra_j","bra_j","bra_j","Aj","Aj","Aj","Aj",NA,NA,NA,315

"i28979","t19361226033489","I. The Ahmedabad Mill-owners’ Association has referred to
arbitration the following questions:
(a) The M. O.A.’s demand for a 20% cut in wages.
(b) Complaint against the New Maneckchowk Mill.
(c) Complaint against Motilal Hirabhai Mill.
(d) Complaint against Rajnagar Mills No. 1.
The reference is subject to two conditions, viz.,
1. The Arbitrators should give a simultaneous award on all the
questions referred to them.
2. With reference to the mill which might have resigned from
the M.O.A. whether the Arbitrators have any jurisdiction in respect of
complaints against them before they enter upon merits.
II.   Sheth   Chamanlal   Girdhardas   Parekh   was   Permanent
Arbitrator on behalf of the M.O.A. but he having resigned the M.O.A.
has appointed Sheth Kasturbhai in his place only with reference to the
questions referred to above. The absence of Sheth Chamanlal has
been felt by all.
III. The Arbitrators had conversations with representatives of the
Segaon.  At  these  meetings  no  evidence  was taken  or  registered
beyond consultations. But at my instance and for my  edification
certain particulars were supplied as embodied in Appendices 2, 6, 7, 8,
and 9. With reference to the admission of these Appendices as part of
the record to be submitted to the Umpire, it is likely that my brother
Arbitrator  will  object  to  their  admission.  I  had  asked  for  the
information embodied in these Appendices in Wardha and Segaon.
There was no objection raised by my brother at the time. Appendix O
Gandhiji wrote this in Gujarati and the English translation was arranged by
Kasturbhai Lalbhai. Vide  also “Letter to Kasturbhai Lalbhai”, 3-1-1937
was asked for by us jointly and if that also is objected to, I do not
mind its exclusion as it is unnecessary for my decision.
IV. The evidence that is submitted to the Umpire is embodied in
the fourteen appendices attached hereto.
V. From the evidence submitted it appears that the T.L.A. has
been  obliged  reluctantly  to  agree   to   the   restricted  reference
(Appendix II). In my opinion, if all the points of dispute between the
two parties had been referred to arbitration, the Arbitrators would have
found it easier to give their Award because such questions are as a rule
closely related to each other. Although therefore there seems to me to
be validity in the T.L.A’s protest, its letter dated November
(Appendix  I)  is a  clear  acceptance,  however  involuntary,  of  the
restriction. Nevertheless the T.L.A. has a perfect right to have all these
questions referred to arbitration.
VI. After having read the papers herewith and having given full
consideration to them on the question of the M.O.A.’s demand for a
wage cut, I have come to the conclusion that evidence submitted
furnishes no cause for any cut.
VII. The last Arbitration Award was given on the 17th January
1935 (Appendix IV, sub-appendix 1).
VIII.  In   that   Award   the   Arbitrator   has   thrown   certain
responsibilities on both the parties of which three are as follows:
(a)  Earnest efforts should be made to standardize the wages of
piece-workers as soon as possible after 1st January 1936.
(b)  With a view to providing for a prompt settlement of all
wages questions on either side in future the parties will meet
and try to evolve a scheme for automatic adjustment of
wages.
(c)  The mills which are desirous of adopting rationalization
will prepare before 30the June 1935 a register of workers
who are working and who are likely to be unemployed in
the departments to which such schemes will apply.
IX. From the evidence submitted to the Arbitrators it appears
that the M.O.A. has not discharged its share of these responsibilities
nor has it taken sufficient pains to do so. In my opinion it is possible,
with sufficient endeavour, to standardize wages and although it is
difficult to evolve a scheme whereby the question of increasing or
decreasing wages can be automatically regulated, I do not consider it
to be impossible. It was the obvious duty of the M.O.A. to keep a
registry of hands in connection with rationalazation. In all these three
matters either party could have availed itself of the assistance of the
Arbitrators but it does not apper to have occurred to them to do so.
X. It is necessary to bear this in mind that the Award of 1935
was originally a voluntary agreement between the parties. To give it
the form of an Award was obviously in the natural course but in view
of the fact that the Award was merely a stabilization of the voluntary
agreement, it was doubly the duty of the parties to give effect to it and
is so today.
XI. In my opinion, not until the M.O.A. has made a serious
attempt  to  carry  out  the  terms  of  the  last  settlement  and  the
impossibility of its being carried out has been proved is it open for the
M.O.A. to ask for a wage cut.
XII. However, the general understanding arrived at between the
two parties has the same value as the  Award  in  determining  the
question of wage cut. The fact that in spite of the admission of the
necessity of having a sub-arbitrator appointed to adjudicate upon
petty disputes arising from time to time the appointment has not been
made is injurious to the harmonious relations between the parties and
becomes a cause of mutual distrust and this in its turn harms the
industry. It seems improper that the workmen’s complaints may not
be disposed of in time or not at all and that the question of wage cut
can still be referred to arbitration.
XIII. That the permanent Arbitrators cannot investigate every
complaint is self-evident. Those who seek justice have to come with
clean hands. In my opinion the M.O.A. has not performed its duty in
this matter and has no right to ask for a wage cut until this duty of
appointing a sub-arbitrator is discharged.
XIV. Such being my opinion it is unnecessary for me to enter
into the merits of the case for wage cut.
XV. But a study of the papers submitted by the parties has left
on me the impression that the period that has elapsed since the last
Award was given is too short to warrant a case for wage cut. Besides,
the M.O.A.’s statement does not substantiate its claim.
XVI. At this stage I would like to restate the principles that for
the good of both parties I have presented to them as a result of my
close and unbroken contact with the industry for a period of 18 years
in the capacity of Arbitrator.
(a)  No cut should be made till the mills have ceased to make
any profit and are obliged to fall back upon their capital
for continuing the industry.
There should be no cut till the wages have reached the level
adequate for maintenance. It is impossible to conceive a
time when the workmen have begun to regard the industry
as if it were their own property and they would then be
prepared to help it out of a crisis by taking the barest
maintenance consisting of a dry crust and working day and
night. That would be a voluntary arrangement. Such cases
are irrelevant to the present consideration.
There should be  a  common  understanding  as  to  what
should be included in determining a living wage.
The consideration of the deterioration in individual mills
cannot form part of a case for a cut in wages of labour in
general.
It is vital to the well-being of the industry that workmen
should be regarded as equals with the shareholders and that
they have therefore every  right  to  possess  an  accurate
knowledge of the transactions of the mills.
There  should  be  a  register  of  all  available  mill-hands
acceptable to both the parties and the custom of taking
labour through any agency other than the T.L.A. should
be stopped.
XVII. I have not presented these principles in the belief that
they will be acceptable either to the brother Arbitrator or to the mill-
owners or even to the workmen. These have not guided my decision
in the present case but I am convinced that without the acceptance of
these principles the industry, i.e., the owners and the workmen, are in
danger.
XVIII. Before concluding the discussion on the wage cut it
seems to be necessary for me to allude to a thing that has come under
my observation in the course of the proceedings. The control of the
M.O.A. over individual mills appears to have slackened. When the
M.O.A’.s decisions appear repugnant to individual mill-owners, they
are tempted to secede. This is undoubtedly a regrettable state of things
and requires to be mended. But it cannot be cited in support of a case
for wage cut. The burden of maintaining such mills cannot be laid on
the shoulders of labour. The deterioration of individual mills has been
found  to  be  due  to  the  shortcomings  of  managers,  out-of-date
machinery or such other internal defects.
XIX. The reduction of wages by this mill is not denied but no
mill has any right to initiate a reduction of its own will. M.O.A. says
that this mill has retired from the Association and the Arbitration has,
therefore, no jurisdiction to entertain the case. One notice of reduction
was issued on 8th August last and the other on the 2nd October last.
Meanwhile the mill seceded from the Association on the 20th August
last.  The  M.O.A’s  statement  that  the   reduction   was  made   on
September 30th is evidently a slip of the pen. Whether it is or not, the
fact of the resignation does not debar the T.L.A. from bringing the
case before Arbitration. If, whenever a mill so acts as to have its action
impeached by the Arbitrators and therefore resigns with a view to
escaping discipline, the system of arbitration becomes meaningless.
How the M.O.A. can enforce discipline against a seceder is another
question. Such a question, when it arises, can be dealt with by resort to
arbitration if it becomes necessary. In my opinion the mill in question
should restore the reduced amount and withdraw the notice. If the
defaulting mill does not carry out this decision the M.O.A. should co-
operate with the T.L.A. in adopting all legitimate measures against the
defaulter.
XX. I can give no definite opinion on the papers submitted. If
the owners of this mill do not furnish the required information the
M.O.A. should procure it without delay and if it is not procured the
T.L.A. is at liberty to come before the Arbitrators. Although the
M.O.A. and the mill do not appear to have given the necessary help to
the T.L.A., the latter erred in assisting the workmen in resorting to the
strike if such assistance was in fact given. However provoking the
circumstances might be, workmen cannot cease work without due
notice nor can owners impose reduction of their own motion. This is
inherent in the acceptance of the principle of arbitration.
Thus on the points submitted to arbitration my decision is as
1. The case for wage cut is dismissed for the reason that the
M.O.A. has failed to prove it.
2. The alleged resignation by the New Maneckchowk Mill does
not put it outside the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Board. The mill
should restore the reduced wages and withdraw the cut notice. If the
owners do not carry out this decision, the M.O.A. should co-operate
with the T.L.A., in taking all legitimate steps to enforce discipline and
should seek the assistance of the Arbitration Board, if necessary.
3. I am unable to give a definite decision about the complaint","histfigures","gandhi","1936","193612","19361226","preindependece","na","iim2","statepol","column","na","na","na","india","na","wardha","na","hindiother","awardinlabourdispute","httpswwwgandhiashramsevagramorggandhiliteraturecollectedworksofmahatmgandhivolume1to98php","mkg1936","11134","34473","notrans","jiya","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","gandhi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","hist","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","mkg_col","yes","yes","others","m","indp","mkg_st","mkg_iim2","indp_col","indp_st","indp_iim2","m_col","m_st","m_iim2","his1936","his_col","his_st","his_iim2","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","mkg","his","others","mkg","his","others","mkg","his","others","mkg","his","others","mkg_col","his_col","o_col","mkg_st","his_st","o_st","mkg_iim2","his_iim2","o_iim2","mint","clean","plib","gujarati","gandhi2","mkg","st","col","na","indp_mkg","indp_col","indp_iim2","indp_st","plib_mkg","plib_col","plib_iim2","plib_st","plib_indp","plib1936","plib_indp_col","mkg_col_1936","mkg_st_1936","indp_col_1936","indp_st_1936","other","n193612","mkg_col_193612","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_st","his_col","his_st","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_c","mkg_c","mkg_c","mkg_c","Gc","Gc","Gc","Gc",NA,NA,NA,2016

"i73120","t20171118578642"," The one who is a master
 is a master of his mind.
 And another type of person, is one who is a slave to his mind.
 Whose mind is not in his control.
 Who cannot have his mind be the way he wants.
 He is a slave.
 The state of his mind
 is not in his hands, it depends on other's behavior.
 And that's why the whole day, instead of becoming the master of himself
 instead of ruling over himself, he tries to rule over others.
 One thing is, if your behavior is irritating me
 something that you do is irritating me.
 If I am fidgeting with my pen?
 Okay, let us take this example. You are fidgeting with your pen
 or if someone is cracking their knuckles
 Some people make noise while taking out eateries like chips from plastic packets.
 Now these things are so small, in fact we cannot even call them situations, these are just small scenes.
 Someone is doing this
 and I am getting disturbed
 and at that time I say, ""You irritate me"".
 Right? ""You irritate me.""
 And then I go to the extent of saying, ""You are very irritating""
 We say this? This is our vocabulary, this is our everyday vocabulary.
 ""It is very irritating.""
 ""This is very irritating.""
 Or ""it is irritating me.""
 Means his behavior
 is creating irritation inside me.
 Right? Now I have two options
 either I take my mind
 out from the effect of the situation
 Which means
 here is your action and here is my irritation.
 Two things are happening and I am not liking this irritation.
 So I want my mind to remain calm again.
 So the first option is that I tell my mind
 ""What is the matter? Why are you getting irritated at such a small thing?""
 ""He is doing it, you can just stay calm and peaceful.""
 That's one option
 that we instruct our own mind.
 Second option, asking the person to be quiet
 so that I can be calm.
 So there are two people I can instruct, in order to get the state of my mind right.
 Either I instruct my own mind to stay calm
 or I instruct you to keep quiet because if you stay quiet, I can be calm.
 But I never thought that I can instruct my own mind.
 Why? Because I thought my mind, does not listen to me.
 And I did not even think of it
 Yes
 I thought this mom and her son have brought something to eat
 there is a very good scene going on in the movie and they are making noises while eating.
 See we are not discussing whether what they are doing is right or wrong.
 If someone is doing something anything like this for that matter
 Often people forget to put their mobile phones on silent during a program or in a cinema hall
 We can say, it is very easy to say that it is very disturbing.
 The phone should not ring. Right.
 The phone should not right at a silent place while praying, meditating, or at a temple, theatre etc.
 But what if it rings
 and I got irritated.
 Now I have two options
 Either I correct my mind or I correct them.
 What should be the end result? That our mind should be calm
 This we always need to remember
 What is the end result behind everything?
 ""I want peace and happiness.""
 I want peace and happiness, which means that I want my mind to be calm.
 The moment you do something like this
 it starts disturbing my calm mind
 why? what? how? why did he do it? etc.
 Yes, we say they they don't teach their kids
 Yes
 these are the thoughts I create, in response to?
 Your act.
 Why does the theatre even allow them to bring these things inside?
 Right. So many thoughts, see?
 Who created these thoughts? I create them in response to?
 the noise that your plastic packets made.
 You made the noise, but who created my thoughts?
 I created them.
 What is the irritation? Here, it is very beautiful
 let us check.
 What is the irritation? The noise from plastic packets?
 Or the thoughts that I create in response to the noise?
 I would rather say that
 the noises which are made
 that specific thing
 is responsible for creating the thoughts inside me.
 I am not creating them.
  
 So a plastic food packet or a pen
 The disturbance is creating such thoughts in me.
 That disturbance is creating such thoughts in me?
 Where are these thoughts created?
 Inside me because of them.
 They are created here right?
 Inside my mind.
 Where is it? it is here.
 Thoughts are created here and the noise is created there.
 The ball pen is being fidgeted, over there.
 The mobile is ringing, over there.
 But the thoughts are created? Here. 
Who creates them?
 This situation.
 But that ball pen...
 His behavior.
 His behavior is there.
 And your behavior is here.
 The outside behavior is affecting my inside one right?
 The outside behavior is there right?
 Now the way you are behaving right now, is very important.
 You behavior is over here.
 Let us say that your behavior is completely wrong.
 Let us say for one minute, that your behavior is completely wrong.
 But it is here.
 Seeing your behavior
 I create my thoughts.
 You said the plastic packet creates thoughts in me.
 That plastic packet creates thoughts in me?
 Yes
 Over here?
 Yes
 Will it enter inside here and create my thoughts?
 It is because of it.
 It is because of it, but who is creating it?
 Does anyone decide what thoughts to create?
 We need to ask ourselves.
 You just said that I create, I choose.
 No let us ask ourselves and let us check it immediately.
 There are hundreds of people in the movie theatre
 and in the center of the theatre a phone rings or there is noise from a plastic packet.
 All the hundred people will respond to it.
 Someone will respond softly , someone will do it loudly and someone will do it in their minds.
 Someone would want other people to tell that person to stop, he  doesn't want to do it himself.
 Right.
 So.
 Different thoughts right?
 So that one plastic packet
 created different thoughts in everyone's mind?
 Yes.
 Who created those different thoughts?
 All those people.
 Who is the creator then?
 I am.
 It is getting created inside me.
 Are you sure?
 Yes.
 I know that for sure that it is happening inside me
 and I am unhappy due to this creation.
 Even that does not matter.
 Important is, it is not as small as it looks.
 That I am the one creating it.
 Earlier we said that the plastic packet is creating a thought inside me.
 We were saying
 that is creating this.
 And that's why we said, ""That is irritating"".
 That is irritating me
 that person is also irritating
 because that person's behaviour
 caused me, to create this.
 Let us at least now remember, be it a little noise from a plastic packet
 or a very big situation in life
 the equation will be the same.
 One thing we need to completely understand
 that no matter what problem we face in life
 the equation should be the same.
 Just like in maths, they used to teach us equations right?
 Before going to the exams, we didn't know the problem
 anything could have come in the exams.
 But if the equations were correct
 then no matter which problem comes, the equation is right.
 We need to fix this equation in our life.
 His behavior.
 He fidgeting with a pen.
 He coming late.
 He lying to me.
 He being insincere.
 He betraying me.
 He doing anything
 it is outside.
 it is over here.
 it is limited to here.
 Someone can betray me financially.
 Someone can hit me physically too.
 Someone can ensure that I lose everything that I have.
 But the way I think in a small situation or even in a big situation
 what I think
 how much I think.
 Like in this case you thought - Why did you get the plastic?
 didn't the parents teach the kids
 why did the theater allow it to be brought inside?
 See these are different
 10 seconds earlier
 a bird was tweeting and a crow was cawing, while you were speaking.
 But I did not even look there.
 It was accepted, was it not?
 Because we are in a forest.
 Birds will tweet, crows will caw and there will be natural noise.
 Then in this case I will not ask why the bird tweeted.
 That is accepted.
 But if someone does it in theater, it is not accepted.
 They can eat it in the interval or eat it outside.
 Yes, is it not? ""You should eat outside, don't you know about it?""
 So whom are we giving all these instructions to?
 To ourselves for the others.
 For the others.
 And what are we conveying while giving them instructions?
 ""You are the cause of my pain.""
 Correct.
 ""You word, your behavior, your act.""
 ""Is causing me pain, I want happiness in life.""
 ""Please change.""
 We made this the equation of life.
 ""You behavior, gives me pain""
 ""and I need happiness in my life, please change yourself.""
 ""Please change.""
 What are we doing in the whole day?
 Changing others... Changing others... Changing others.
 ""Do not slam the door of my car so hard, it hurts me.""
 Even that is okay.
 If you are in a car and someone shuts the door very hard, you need to tell them.
 But not get irritated.
 I cannot say that he does not have brain, he does not know how to sit in a car, why did I allow him inside?
 He asked for a lift and then slammed the car door.
 Those years, cars had windows that had to be rolled up or down.
 We had to open them manually, as there was no air conditioner.
 So I had get down and roll up the window after that person got out.
 That is irritation too.
 See?
 And then, after thinking all this
 you already thought about it
 I give him a lift.
 Even that is not a problem that you thought about it
 you created all these thoughts and your mind got disturbed.
 There is no problem.
 I will blame him then.
 You blamed him.
  
 He was the one who opened kept the window open and left.
 he slammed the door
 shouldn't he have shown some courtesy?
 No. Perfect. See all these lines are so beautiful.
 He asked for lift
 Yes
 he left the window open
 he slammed the door
 His shoes were muddy so that mud also got into my car.
 mud got into my car, he did all these things.
 And he was about to light a cigarette too but I scolded him.
 Ok. So all this was done by him.
 So we are going to hold him responsible for all these four things.
 Asked for a lift,  left the window open, slammed the door, entered with  muddy shoes, and even smoked a cigarette.
 Who is responsible for all these 5 things? 
He.
 He is responsible.
 What thoughts I created, looking at all those things.
 For that who is responsible?
 I was forced to think right?
 Who is the one who gets ""forced"" to do anything?
 A slave.
 You look at it practically, you are sitting here?
 Yes.
 You can feel the heat?
 You will say, ""It feels so hot.""
 Perfect.
 When you go to a shady place, you will say it feels cool.
 Perfect
 Similarly in that car incident, I felt bad for everything.
 Now during all this, when you are thinking about this person who got out from the car now.
 These are very small things in life.
 He did not just leave the car, he left a lot of problems behind while leaving.
 Yes he left behind, so many problems. He left the window open, the car got dirty, there is a smell of cigarette
 and maybe the door also got damaged. He has given all these problems.
 Challenges.
 Now you are thinking about them constantly.
 5 minutes have passed and irritation is getting created inside you
 Meanwhile
 You get a phone call
 and that call was about a bigger issue.
 Let us say it was about your business
 or in stock market or anywhere else
 Or something else
 A big situation has come where something has gone wrong.
 Now you will not remember that person right?
 Now this bigger issue will be on my mind.
 Now that thing (car incident) is gone.
 Now that thought has gone.
 If that person was creating that thought, it would be there.
 What happened is
 I took that person's behavior as a stimulus
 and created those thoughts
 and the moment some other stimulus came
 that thought got finished.
 Now this next thought begins.
 Let us say I had to incur a huge loss in the stock market
 Now I started thinking about that. I will say "" It's because of today's stock market.""
 ""It is because of all this fluctuation happening in the financial sector.""
 And then I kept thinking.
 And then I said who is responsible?
The market.
 When the market fluctuates, it affects people's blood pressure and can cause depression.
 Amidst all this, suppose you get another call.
 Informing that something happened to a family member.
 Now the stock market will not affect me anymore.
 Now I forgot that thing, that thought is gone now.

In India, the sea level rise and increase in extreme weather events due to climate change may increase flooding, submergence, ingress of saline water in low lying coastal areas.(c) & (d) Earth System Science Organization has carried out mapping and demarcation of multi-hazard coastal vulnerability. The Gulfs of Kambhat and Kachchh in Gujarat show very high vulnerability indices, with the inlets of Kachchh showing localized vulnerability. Relatively low vulnerability indices are reported along the zones of mangroves that help in breaking the large amplitude waves, dissipating the energy and hence act as a natural barrier. Thirty two States and Union Territories have prepared State Action Plan on Climate Change to prioritise state specific issues relating to climate change including on coastal areas. Further, the Government has carried out a detailed mapping of high tide line, environmentally sensitive areas, critically vulnerable coastal areas, sediment cells and hazard line for all the coastal stretches in the country taking into account shoreline changes and impact of climate change on sea level rise. All the States have been requested to formulate coastal zone management plans with the objective of sustainable development of these areas including measures required for adaptation against impacts of climate change.","minister","ls16","2017","201712","20171222","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2017","262159","334296","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","drmaheshsharma","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2017","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2017","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2017","l16_nt_2017","bjp_qna_2017","bjp_nt_2017","other","n201712","l16_qna_201712","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","EnvironmentForestsandClimateChange","awhethertheClimateChangehasanyadverseimpactonlowlyingcoastalregionsinthecountrybifsothedetailsthereofcwhethertheGovernmenthasidentifiedtheregionsdistrictsinthecountrythatarevulnerabletoilleffectsofClimateChangeanddifsotheStatewisedetailsthereofandthestepsbeingtakenbytheGovernmentinthisregard","newdelhi",233

Babu Ram Narayan Singh : (a) Will the Honourable the Labour Member please state whether there has been any proposal for the installation of pipes for the supply of unfiltered water in the courtyards of the Orthodox quarters in the D.I.Z. and Minto Road areas in New Delhi ?
Is he aware of the fact that gallons of filtered water are being wasted every day in every quarters in the  washing  of  floor, W.C., watering of flowers, plants or vegetables and in the sprinkling of water on the khus ki tatties during the hot weather?
In view of the approaching hot weather will he please consider advisability of installing, the  unfiltered  water supply in the quarters, in the wider interest of service and economy ?     If not, why not ?
The Honourable Dr. B. R. Ambedkar : (a) Yes.
No. A bend and a gland cock are provided on the hydrants of unfiltered water at convenient places near these quarters at the beginning of every summer season to enable the occupants to draw unfiltered water and I do not think that the consumption   of filtered water for these purposes during the remaining part     of the year is excessive.

No. The Government have already considered this suggestion very carefully in the past and dropped it mainly on account of the excessive expenditure involved.","histfigures","ambedkar","1946","194603","19460329","preindependence","na","iim2","nationalpol","debate","na","na","na","tobefilled","tobefilled","tobefilled","tobefilled","english","supplyofunfilteredwaterinquartersin","httpdrambedkarwritingsgovinuploaduploadfilesfilesvolume_10pdf","bra1946","814","51371","notrans","surabh","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","ambedkar","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","hist","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","bra_deb","na","yes","others","m","aiscf","bra_nt","bra_iim2","aiscf_deb","aiscf_nt","aiscf_iim2","m_deb","m_nt","m_iim2","his1946","his_deb","his_nt","his_iim2","bra","bra","bra","bra","bra","bra","bra","bra","bra","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","bra","his","others","bra","his","others","bra","his","others","bra","his","others","bra_deb","his_deb","o_deb","bra_nt","his_nt","o_nt","bra_iim2","his_iim2","o_iim2","mint","clean","plib","english","ambedkar","bra","nt","deb","na","aiscf_bra","aiscf_deb","aiscf_iim2","aiscf_nt","plib_bra","plib_deb","plib_iim2","plib_nt","plib_aiscf","plib1946","plib_aiscf_deb","bra_deb_1946","bra_nt_1946","aiscf_deb_1946","aiscf_nt_1946","other","n194603","bra_deb_194603","bra_deb","bra_deb","bra_deb","bra_nt","his_deb","his_nt","bra_deb","bra_deb","bra_deb","bra_deb","bra_j","bra_j","bra_j","bra_j","Aj","Aj","Aj","Aj",NA,NA,NA,221

"i657467","t20161207272511","a) to (e) The enormity of skill development programmes is aggravated by the fact that skill training efforts cut across multiple sectors and require the involvement of diverse stakeholders such as: multiple Government departments at the Centre and State levels, private training providers, educational and training institutions, employers, industry associations, assessment and certification bodies and trainees. All these stakeholders need to align their work together in order to achieve the target of Skill India. The Government having realised the need to evolve appropriate skill development framework, removal of disconnect between the demand and supply for skilled manpower through vocational and technical training, to increase the industry participation and to create appropriate skilled manpower in the Country, has set up the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) to drive the Skill India in a Mission Mode in order to converge existing skill initiatives and combine scale and quality of skilling efforts, with speed. The Ministry, has launched the National Skill Development Mission (NSDM) to provide overall institutional framework to rapidly implement and scale up skill development efforts across India. This framework for implementation will provide strategic direction to State Governments and establish a clear line of action to enable India to achieve its skilling targets. The Directorate General of Training (DGT) under this Ministry is implementing Dual System of Training in Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) across the country with effect from August, 2016. In Dual System of Training, for a two year course it is mandatory that nine months training would be in the industry and remaining period would be in the ITIs. This system enables industries to partner with Government and Private Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) for conducting training programmes under high employability courses to fulfil the needs of the industries. Further, the Flexible Memorandum of Understanding (Flexi-MoU) policy introduced in the year 2014 by Directorate General of Training (erstwhile Directorate General of Employment & Training) allows industries to take advantage of various schemes for conducting training programmes in higher employment potential courses. The courses under the scheme are designed according to the needs of industries. The Government has also launched Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) which is a reward based, demand driven scheme. PMKVY (2016-2020) aims to enhance Industry participation in skill training by incentivizing Training Centers (TCs) and Trainees for providing placement to trained candidates. Industry, Sector Skill Councils (SSCs), Training Centres (TCs), trainees are important stakeholders in the endeavor of industry participation. TCs are required to have a dedicated mentorship-cum-placement cell for industry linkage and placement of candidates. Training Providers are mandated to organize Placement/ Rozgar Melas every six months with support from the SSCs and to ensure the participation of local industry. Additionally, there is also a provision to provide post placement support to candidates from special areas, women and Persons with Disabilities (PwDs). In order to provide support to all the trainees for entrepreneurship development, all the Training Centers are mandated to impart training in Soft Skills, Entrepreneurship, Financial and Digital Literacy alongwith providing training according to the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF).","minister","ls16","2016","201612","20161207","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2016","290449","319780","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2016","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2016","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2016","l16_nt_2016","bjp_qna_2016","bjp_nt_2016","other","n201612","l16_qna_201612","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","SkillDevelopmentandEntrepreneurship","awhethertheGovernmentisfacinglackofcoordinationamongitsskilldevelopmentprogrammesandifsothedetailsthereofbwhetherthereisdismalinvolvementofindustryandemployersintheskilltrainingstructuressuchasITIscifsothedetailsthereofandthereasonstherefordwhethertheGovernmentisstrugglingwithstudentmobilizationfortheseprogrammesduetothetraditionalmindsetlowwillingnesstomigratelowsalariesatentryleveletcandeifsothedetailsthereofalongwiththemeasuresadoptedbytheGovernmenttoovercometheseissues","newdelhi",513

The Per Capita Income at the national level, which was Rs.24,143 in the year 2004-05, stands at Rs.54,835 in the year 2010-11, showing an increase of more than 120%.(b) The details of State/UT-wise per capita income (Net State Domestic Product at factor cost) at current prices, for the years 2004-05 to 2009-10, as compiled and provided by the Directorates of Economics & Statistics of the States, are given in the table at Annex.(c) The per capita income of several States is more than the national average. However, the regional imbalance and disparity among various States and UTs in the country is largely due to historical difference in initial conditions, natural resource endowments, level of industrialization and differences in human capital indicators viz.education, health, etc. Per capita income is only an indicator of the disparity and not the cause.(d) The Government has been taking several measures to increase the per capita income of States in a balanced manner. The Eleventh Five Year Plan (EFPY) takes cognizance of the disparities among States, regions within States. One of the basic objectives of the development planning in India is to reduce economic inequalities and raise the level of economic development in the country in a balanced manner. With a view to bring down disparities, the EFPY monitors 13 out of 27 monitorable national targets state-wise. The policy instruments in this regard include plan and non-plan transfer of resources from the Centre to the States favouring less developed states, establishment of public sector units, tax incentives for setting up of private industries in the backward regions, etc. A number of programmes have been initiated to reduce income disparity between States. These include Backward Regions Grant Fund (BRGF), Hill Area Development Programme/ Western Ghats Development Programme, etc.","minister","ls15","2011","201108","20110804","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2011","186593","231925","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","independentcharge","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2011","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2011","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2011","l15_nt_2011","inc_qna_2011","inc_nt_2011","other","n201108","l15_qna_201108","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","StatisticsandProgrammeImplementation","awhetherpercapitaincomehasincreasedsubstantiallyinthecountryatpresentbifsothedetailsthereofStatewisecwhetherpercapitaincomeinseveralStatesarehigherthanthatofnationalaverageresultinginasituationofregionalimbalanceanddisparityinthecountryanddifsothedetailsthereofalongwiththereactionoftheGovernmentinthisregard","newdelhi",329

The shortages vary from state to state on month to month, day to day and hour to hour basis depending upon the demand and supply of power. The energy and peaking shortage in the country during 2009-10 (April to October, 2009) was 9.8 % and 12.6 % respectively. The state-wise details in this regard are enclosed at Annex. The main reasons for shortage of power is due to growth in demand for electricity outstripping the growth in electricity generation and capacity addition in the States. The other reasons are  (i) delayed and insufficient rains in catchment areas of reservoirs and hydro power projects,  (ii) low Plant Load Factor of some of the thermal generating units, mostly in the State Sector,  (iii) Inadequate availability of gas, nuclear fuel and coal,  (iv) very high prices of gas and naphtha in international market making these fuels unaffordable,  (v) high Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses including theft of electricity, and  (vi) poor financial position of state utilities making it difficult for them to raise the resources necessary for making the required investments to create adequate generation, transmission and distribution system.(c) & (d) : No funds are provided by the Government to the states to overcome shortage of power. The states are required to take steps to meet enhanced demand for power through various measures and funds required, if any, are to be arranged by them.(e) : The steps taken / being taken by the Government to enhance generation and mitigate shortage of power in the country include quantum jump in generating capacity addition envisaged during the 11th Plan, development of Ultra Mega Power Projects of 4,000 MW each, harnessing surplus captive power into the grid, import of coal, enhanced availability of gas from KG basin, augmentation of manufacturing capacity of equipment for electric power in the country, demand side management, energy efficiency and energy conservation measures, etc.","minister","ls15","2009","200911","20091120","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2009","211311","203101","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shribharatsinhsolanki","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2009","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2009","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2009","l15_nt_2009","inc_qna_2009","inc_nt_2009","other","n200911","l15_qna_200911","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","Power","awhetherthereisacuteshortageofpowerinthecountrycausingslowdownintheindustrialsectorbifsothedetailsthereofandthereasonsthereforStateUTwisecwhethertheGovernmentproposestoallocatesanctionmorefundstotheStatesfacingpowershortagedifsothedetailsthereofandethestepstakenbytheGovernmenttomeettheshortageofpowerandenhancepowergenerationinthecountry","newdelhi",342

"i9446","t19250512552917","Mahatma Gandhi in the course of his speech said he was grateful for the
addresses, but was sorry that he could not bring either of the Ali Brothers with him.
He further regretted that Mr. Sen Gupta was also absent. Last time when he visited
their place, he was prohibited from speaking by the orders of the Government. He
thanked the Municipality for the splendid work they were doing. He did not know
whether it was useful to make education compulsory. There were two opinions on the
subject. He, however, promised to think over the matter more carefully. He thanked
the Municipality for stopping drink and making its employees wear khaddar. Nothing
could be done except by khaddar. Civil disobedience was an impossibility without
khaddar. The charkha was necessary to drive poverty out of the country. His
movement was for self-purification. He would never say anything which he did not do
himself.2
I have been just now asked to say a few words in English. I
know the Bengali infatuation for English. You have heard every word
I said translated fairly accurately in Bengali, your mother tongue. I
can’t imagine I can drive truth home with greater force, or in clearer
words, through the medium of a language which is as foreign to you
as it is to me. However, I have to do my work and if I convert a few
people to the cult of khaddar or convince, if they are not already
convinced, a few of them to the truths of non-violence through the
medium of the English language, I should do so. And therefore, if I
take up your time just now by speaking in English, it is merely to
flatter those who want me to speak in English, so that, perchance, if
they have not yet seen the very simple truth that I have been speaking
to the masses of India, they might be able to see it.

One of my co-workers said some years ago, writing in
connection with the spinning-wheel, that its very simplicity frightened
the educated classes. He said, and he said it with great truth in it, that
because of its simplicity the educated Indians fail to understand its
beauty and grand meaning. Simple as the spinning-wheel is, I am
absolutely convinced, after years of continuous, deep and powerful
thinking, that there is nothing before India so efficacious for her
many ills as the spinning-wheel and khaddar.

The problems of our dear country are so vast, so complex that
nothing but a very simple remedy will solve the riddle. The complex
character of the education and the training that we have received has
confounded our thoughts, paralysed our brains and, unless we have
something presented to us in an inexplicable manner, we refuse to see
the truth that lies in it.

But if you tax your brains or, better still, if you retire into your
private rooms to bend your knee before God and ask Him to guide
you, He will guide your hand and put it unerringly on the spinning-
wheel. We have spoken, we have delivered speeches, we have written in
newspapers, we have published books, we have even made researches.
But the age of speaking, the age of writing, the age of delivering
oration is gone, never to return again. The age of action has
commenced. You have to battle not against a race of speakers, but you
have to give battle to the race of born workers—a race that has not
known what it is to yield, a race that has inflexible determination, a
race which is made of some of the finest soldiers in the world. No
diplomacy that we can call to our aid will be able to do the task that is
before everyone of us. You want mass consciousness, you want cooperation
of the masses? You want Councillors to speak with power.
At the present moment there is no power in their words—there is no
power in their resolutions— not because they don’t know how to
speak. Deshbandhu has shown how he can outwit the Government in
defeating its resolution, defeating its policy. But he can do little unless
he has power behind him. You and I, everyone of us, can’t go to the
Councils. I have said repeatedly I don’t believe in Councils. But I
have granted, those who believe in Councils should go there. But I
want to arm the Councillors with power. I do not want them to become
discredited after they have gone there. I want them to be listened to
with respect and attention by the Government. How is that to be done?
Not by holding mass meetings, not by passing resolutions, not by
approving of their policy of resolutions, but by giving some power to
them. And you will not, cannot, give them power unless you have
evolved it for yourselves, in yourselves. We have not got power. I defy
anybody to match the violence of the Government with violence. No
matter what may have been [done] in other parts of the world, I am
positively certain that we should not attain our freedom by violent
means.

I have placed, therefore, a non-violent programme with full
knowledge of what I am doing and not because it is a religion, as it is
with me, but because it is expedient. It is the only politics for the
country. And he who has any political wisdom must come to the
conclusion that violent means will serve no earthly purpose.
understand, I appreciate the impatience of those who are burning to
deliver the country from the shackles that bind her. I yield to none in
my desire to free the country from the shackles. But I consider myself
to be a sane man. I regard myself as having a great deal of common
sense. I regard myself as a man who has been something of the world.
I am born a fighter from the earliest days of my youth. I am fighting
even though it may be with my brothers, friends, wife, children, my
co-religionists and, if it is Mussalman, with Mussalmans. But
throughout my fight I have understood that one weapon is common
to all these fights and that is the weapon of non-violence.

I could not fight my wife with violence, I could not fight my
brothers with violence, I refuse to fight the Mussalmans with violence
and I dare not fight the Hindus, some of whom are opposing me on
the question of untouchability, with violence. I, therefore, deduce
from that fund of experience that I cannot fight Englishmen with
violence. You have seen in one of my writings that I have converted
more Englishmen to love India than any single one of the present
generation. I know it is a large claim, it is a proud claim, but it is the
claim of the humble man, who has put forth that claim in all humility.
I feel, if we are to fight our battle non-violently it will not be by mere
words. Non-violence must be expressed in action. Action without
intermission, without rest, without recreation, without the slightest
pause, with continuous determination—action with the fullest faith in
its efficacy is the only remedy for India and the only remedy that I
can place in the hands of those little girls and boys, in the hands of the
grownup people, in the hands of poets and philosophers, in the hands
of sannyasins, politicians, learned professors and sweepers, in the
hands of women and in the hands of robust men. The only universal
remedy I can discover today is the spinning-wheel. Multiply the force
of this charkha and spin until it is done by 3 hundred millions of men
and then tell me what its power will be, tell me then what it will not do.
Is there nothing that we can claim to our credit? Throughout all this
long, dreary forty years of political life, we have not been able to show
to the world one simple action done to perfection and to fulfilment.
We have placed before ourselves many programmes, I place before
the nation only one programme and ask the nation to fulfil that
programme before it can dare think of any other. Is it an impossible
programme that you and I should wear nothing but khaddar, although
it may be costly? It may be coarse. If it is costly, than, tear it into half
and do cover your nakedness with half the cloth and it will go to your
credit in the book of life. If it is coarse, then, for the sake of India,
you will wear coarse cloth. Understand that the slavery of India is
coarser than the coarsest khaddar, understand that the pauperism of
India is infinitely coarser than the coarsest khaddar that can be
produced in Chittagong. If you have heart to think for famishing
millions of India, if you have heart to spin, then spin till your hands
are paralysed and wear khaddar till you perspire in the coarsest khadi
and then you will find that the swaraj of my dream—and of your
dream—will break forth in the horizon and then you will dance in
joy.

with the Municipality and, if possible have a separate trust made for
it.3 I think that we are thus making a good use of the library but, of
course, if the other trustees do not like this idea, we should not hesitate
to ask for its return. This is not a question of prestige, and therefore
whatever is proper should be done. I have no doubt Kakasaheb will be
big enough not to mind it. When I think over the matter further, I
must admit that even if Kakasaheb overlooked these points, I should
have considered whether he had the necessary authority. Rushed as I
was, I dealt with many matters hurriedly and this was one of those into

the Gujarat Vidyapith Library also was disposed of in like manner, after Gandhiji had
a discussion with D. B. Kalelkar. Vallabhbhai Patel and some other trustees of the
Vidyapith who were in jail at that time could not be consulted. Vallabhbhai Patel,
who did not like the move when he heard of it in jail, sought Gandhiji’s guidance after
his release. Vide also “Letter of Vallabhbhai Patel”, 21-8-1934 and “Letter to G.V.

VALLABHBHAI PATEL: According to Kakasaheb, it was you who first suggested
that the Vidyapith library might be given to the Municipality.
GANDHIJI: I do not remember making  this suggestion, but if he
says so, I am prepared to accept that I may have done so
It is true that they too had no  authority. I would only say this
much that any bequest made by one who had no authority to make it
could always be taken back. If, therefore, it is considered proper to
take these books back, they should be taken back. I  think, however,
that if at that time kakasaheb had aske every body, possibly everyone

"i560955","t20101122033182","  (a) to (d): A statement is attached. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2012 FOR ANSWER ON 22. 11.2010  There has been a shortage of officers in the Armed Forces. In Army, the existing strength of officers is 35,354 against authorised strength of 47,864 with a shortage of 12,510. In Navy, the existing strength of officers is 7,972 against authorised strength of 9,719 with a shortage of 1,747 and in Air Force, the existing strength of officers is 11,195 against authorised strength of 12,211 with a shortage of 1,016. There is no significant shortage of Personnel Below Officer Rank (PBOR) in the Armed Forces. The shortage of officers in the Armed Forces is partly attributable to accretions from time to time, tough selection procedures, difficult service conditions coupled with perceived high degree of risk involved in service career. A number of steps have been taken to attract the talented youth to join the Armed Forces. All officers including those in Short Service Commission (SSC) are now eligible to hold substantive rank of Captain, Major and Lieutenant Colonel after 2, 6 and 13 years of reckonable service respectively. The tenure of SSC officers has been increased from 10 years to 14 years. A total number of 750 posts of Lt. Colonel have been upgraded to Colonel towards implementation of AV Singh Committee Report (Phase-I). Further, 1896 additional posts in the ranks of Colonel, Brigadier, Major General and Lieutenant General and their equivalents in the other two Services have been upgraded towards implementation of AV Singh Committee Report (Phase-II). The implementation of recommendations of the VI Central Pay Commission with substantial improvement in the pay structure of officers of Armed Forces has made the Services more attractive. The Armed Forces have also undertaken sustained image projection and publicity campaign to create awareness among the youth on the advantages of taking up a challenging and satisfying career. Awareness campaigns, participation in career fairs and exhibitions, advertisements in print and electronic media, motivational lectures in schools, colleges are also some of the other measures in this direction.

"i40863","t19460127880660","WORKERS’ CONFERENCE, MADRAS
Mahatma Gandhi said that many women enquired of him about the nature of
work they might do. He had been telling repeatedly, and he would say again that
women should go to villages and work there. They must attend to the health and
sanitation of the villages and to the education and culture of the womenfolk. All these
should be done in a spirit of love and service and not as a mere formality.
Replying to a question relating to parliamentary programme, Mahatma Gandhi
said that the question of entering legislatures was a small matter. Only a limited
number of women could engage themselves in this work, whereas the constructive
programme provided scope for all of them. Mahatma Gandhi added that he had no
objection to women standing for election to legislatures; but they must enter the
legislatures with the idea of serving the people, always keeping in mind the principle
of truth and  non-violence.  But how  many  of  them  would be  able  to  enter  the
legislatures in a spirit of service? They must also have a clear idea beforehand as to
what they would do inside the legislatures. The parliamentary programme was like
building from the top. Their aim must be to build from below so that the foundation
would be strong and the structure good. If any mistake occurred while building from
the bottom, it could be rectified immediately, and the harm done would not be much.
On the other hand, if a mistake was committed in the other programme, the entire
structure might collapse and the whole country stood to lose thereby.
The next question related to receiving assistance from Christian Missionaries
in a free India.  Gandhiji declared that they could certainly accept help not only from
Christian Misssionaries but from others also, if such help was offered sincerely and
in a spirit of service to the country. There was before them the example of the late
Deenabandhu Andrews. He was a Christian. He served India and gave his life for India.
India required the help of all men of goodwill who were prepared to offer that help in a
spirit of love and service.
In reply to another question, Mahatmaa Gandhi said that the wife or dependent
of a Government servant could do national work, provided she was ready to do so
without fear of her property being consfiscated or the  education  of  her  children
suffering. If any  woman  thought  that  by  doing constructive national  work  her
children stood to lose privilege they might otherwise get from the Government, she
should not undertake the work.
He said that this sphere of work was large and all were welcome. It was the
constructive programme that  was responsible  for  creating an  awakening in  the
country. It was only through constructive programme that they would be able to
retain their freedom when it was won. The important part of the constructive pro-
gramme was to develop purity of body and mind and to educate their children accor-
ding to the Nayee Talim or New Education. Thereby their girls and boys would grow
into self-supporting and independent citizens. They wanted many workers to go out
into the villages and work among the people. Educated women should make it a point
to get into villages and teach the children to read and write and to lead clean lives. If
these things were done, the constructive programme would have achieved its purpose.
If they had a capital of one crore of rupees, they should be able to multiply it
and not allow themselves to squander away what they had. All of them were aware that
he  would not  allow  even  a pie  being  spent  unnecessarily.    The  construrctive
programme, if correctly followed, would not only pay its way but also add to the
capital. Therein lay its greatness.

At the +2 level schools it is being implemented through the State School Councils/Boards covering all the States and Union Territory administrations.(b) Details of funds allocated under the Scheme are as under:- 2000-01      2001-02 2002-03 3065 lakh     3285 lakh 3144 lakh  (c) Details of funds released/utilized and remained unspent during the said period are annexed.(d) NSS is a centrally sponsored scheme and the pattern of sharing expenditure is in the ratio of 3:1 in the case of North Eastern States including Sikkim and Himachal Pradesh and other hilly areas as notified by the Planning Commission and 7:5 in the case of other States/Union Territories. In case of Jammu & Kashmir and Union Territories without legislatures the entire expenditure is met by the Central Government. The 1st instalment of the Central Share is released to the States/U. Ts in the last quarter of the preceding year. The State Government is supposed to release its matching share to the Universities/Colleges by the 30th of May. As some States are facing severe resources crunch they are not able to release their share timely. This leads to unspent balance at the end of the year. Another reason for the high level of unspent balance is accumulation of funds over a number of years.(e) & (f): The Ministry has been pursuing the matter with the States and has decided to proportionately reduce the share of central grant in a manner so that the unspent balance gets adjusted and the activities of NSS also do not suffer due to non release of funds.

"i638304","t20151202480969","  (a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT LAID ON THE TABLE OF THE LOK SABHA IN REPLY (a) to (d) TO STARRED QUESTION NO.41 REGARDING EARTHQUAKESTO BE ANSWERED ON WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 02, 2015  (a) During the current year so far, 392 earthquakes of magnitude greater than 3, have been located by the seismological network maintained and operated by Earth System Science Organisation-National Centre for Seismology (ESSO-NCS). Details are given in Annexure-I. However, a total of 136 earthquakes have occurred over India in the current year so far; out of which 114 events have occurred in Zone-V, 14 numbers in Zone-IV, 5 in Zone-III and 3 in Zone-II, respectively. In the current year, 25 April 2015 Nepal earthquake and its aftershocks caused loss of life and property in Indian territory also.102 deaths have been reported (Bihar-79; Uttar Pradesh-19; West Bengal-3; and Rajasthan-1) and about 13,000 houses were reported damaged. The maximum loss of life and damage to property occurred in Bihar. It is estimated that the housing property of Rs.140 lakh was damaged in Bihar.4 deaths have been reported in Jammu & Kashmir due to the 26 October 2015 Afghanistan earthquake.(b) Analysis of past 30 years of earthquake data suggests that there is no increase or decrease in seismicity rate. Although no committee has been constituted to study and analyze the movement of Indian tectonic plate, several institutes along with ESSO-NCS, New Delhi like National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) Hyderabad, Fourth Paradigm Institute Bangalore, Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG) Mumbai, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) Dehradun, etc.are involved in institutional studies. Studies have also revealed that Indian plate moves at the rate of about 5 cm/year towards northeast.(c) There is a mechanism of international sharing of information on earthquakes between several countries including Japan, as such no specific assistance is taken from any country.(d) Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has published several guidelines and building codes for construction of earthquake resistant structures and for retrofitting of existing buildings. These guidelines are in wide circulation amongst the public and the administrative authorities responsible for the design and construction of earthquake resistant structures in earthquake prone areas. National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Ministry of Earth Sciences and other state Disaster Management Authorities, have also taken up various initiatives to educate and enhance awareness amongst general public and school children on the general aspects of earthquakes, their impacts and measures to mitigate losses caused by them. A National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) is also functional under the general superintendence, direction and control of the NDMA for the purpose of specialized response to natural and man-made disasters. Markets, schools, hospitals and Railway and Bus stations, airports etc.are regularly sensitized by organising mock drills and information dissemination relating to evacuation and steps to be taken during rescue and relief operations.","minister","ls16","2015","201512","20151202","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2015","287232","300617","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","DRHARSHVARDHAN","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2015","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2015","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2015","l16_nt_2015","bjp_qna_2015","bjp_nt_2015","other","n201512","l16_qna_201512","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","EarthSciences","athedetailsofseismictremorsreportedduringthecurrentyearsofaralongwiththeirintensitylocationwiseandthelossoflifeandpropertyreportedthereinbwhethertheGovernmenthasconductedanystudyaboutincreasingincidentsofearthquakesandconstitutedacommitteetostudyandanalysethemovementofIndiantectonicplateandifsothedetailsandoutcomethereofcwhethertheGovernmentistakingassistancefromJapanandotherforeigncountriestostudythesameandifsothedetailsthereofanddthestepstakenbytheGovernmenttominimisethedamageduetoearthquakesofhighintensity","newdelhi",501
"i619059","t20140808198209","  (a) to (d): A statement is placed on the Table of the House. Statement referred to in the reply to LOK SABHA Starred Question no 443 (a to d) by Shri Vijay Kumar Hansdak, Member of Parliament, for 8th August, 2014 regarding Protection of Small Investors. SEBI`s objective as contained in its preamble is to protect the interests of the investors in securities and to promote the development of and to regulate the securities market. These objectives have been achieved by SEBI by adopting the tools of fair and transparent regulations, effective enforcement, and empowering investors through the mechanism of investor education. The central theme of various provisions of SEBI Act and the rules and regulations made thereunder is investor protection. For instance, section 11, which is the enabling provision of SEBI Act empowers SEBI inter alia to make regulations, register market intermediaries, calling for information, prohibiting insider trading and other market irregularities. Section 11B empowers SEBI to take enforcement actions against the erring entities. In exercise of these powers, SEBI has framed various regulations for the protection of the interest of investors. Notable among them are SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirement) Regulations, 2009, SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 and SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992, SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 2011 and SEBI (Investor Protection and Education Fund) Regulations, 2009. The securities market is dynamic and there is need to keep pace with the evolving environment. Appropriate and necessary periodic reviews of the extant regulatory framework and various issue related processes are undertaken with an aim to improve the quality of public offerings and expanding their reach amongst investors. Such reviews facilitate capital raising for trade and industry through the public offerings route while also protecting the interest of investors. SEBI has been continuously endeavouring to increase the efficiency in the securities market by encouraging participation of retail investors while also ensuring protection of the small investors. While, it may not be possible to quantify the impact of various measures taken by SEBI, it is expected that these measures shall, over a period of time, lead to fair, transparent and orderly functioning of the securities market which would also ensure protection of the interest of the investors. SEBI takes up grievances with regard to non receipt of dividend, non receipt of refund in case of a public issue, non receipt redemption amount of debentures and interest on debentures. SEBI takes up the complaints with concerned companies and in case of non resolution of complaints takes punitive action under section 11B/15C of the SEBI Act, which is wide in scope. The details including the number of individual complaints reported during each of the last three years and the current year in the categories of non receipt of dividend, non receipt of refund in case of a public issue, non receipt of redemption amount of debentures and interest on debentures are annexed to the statement. Companies which fail to redress investors grievances face action under sections 11B/15C of the SEBI Act, 1992. Details of action taken for non-redressal of investor grievances year- wise, during the last three years and current year in respect of such companies are as follows:  Sr. No. Financial year   Number of cases where     Orders Passed u/s  Order passed u/s      11B of the SEBI Act  15C of the SEBI Act 1 2011-2012  11   6 2 2012-2013  4   10 3 2013-2014  Nil   35 4 2014-2015   3   1 (Till June 30, 2014) # Orders against 5 more entities have been disposed off","minister","ls16","2014","201408","20140808","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2014","239288","281371","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shriarunjaitley","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2014","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2014","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2014","l16_nt_2014","bjp_qna_2014","bjp_nt_2014","other","n201408","l16_qna_201408","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","Finance","awhethertheexistinglawsregulationsguidelinesareadequatetoprotecttheinterestofsmallinvestorsinthestockmarketbifsothedetailsthereofandifnotthemeasurestakenbytheGovernmentSecuritiesandExchangeBoardofIndiaSEBIforprotectionofsmallinvestorsandthesuccessachievedasaresultthereofcWhetherithascometothenoticeoftheGovernmentSEBIthatanumberofcompanieshavereportedlynotpaidtheduestothesmallinvestorsandarestilltradingactivelyinthestockmarketanddIfsothedetailsthereofincludingthenumberofcomplaintsreportedduringeachofthelastthreeyearsandthecurrentyearalongwiththeactioninitiatedbyGovernmentSEBIagainsttheerringcompaniescompanywise","newdelhi",607

"i27680","t19351027841316","A volunteer who has taken up the task of sanitation in villages
has written a long letter from which I give the following extract2.
This letter may be divided into two parts—one relating to the
incopetence  of  the  ordinary  worker  and  the  other  about  the
difficulties involved in the work of sanitation. It can certainly be said
that very little progress, if at all, can be made in a task which is not
done in an enlightened manner.
A volunteer who does his work with sincerity will indeed come
at last to do it intelligently. It may so happen that a person may do the
work entrusted to him through a sense of loyalty to his superior but
there may be an absence both of sincerity and knowledge. Such
volunteers continue to give the expected results and we can hardly
hope for any enlightenment or of any new discoveries resulting from
their work. Every volunteer should become engrossed in the work
entrusted to him and keep doing research in it. From experiences
published in Harijan we find that this has happened in certain places.
Some are seeking ways and means to do away with the indifference of
the people, while others are trying to find out how night-soil can be
disposed of with the least expenditure and in the simplest manner.
This is happening in relation to Sindi.  The  people's  indifference
persists. There is no response from them. Hence, Mirabehn has as a
last resort gone to live there. Underlying this is the conviction that the
people's indifference cannot be done away with so long as we do not
find  out  someone  to  live amongst  the  people  of  every  village.
Methods are being evolved also for the rapid disposal of night-soil.
There is no end to the difficulties of volunteers; the work of
sanitation is more difficult than all other forms of service, as it is
regarded as the meanest of tasks. There is a feeling of great disgust
attached to it. Very few persons are prepared to do this work. I am of
the opinion that there should be only one volunteer for every village.
It is possible that this will yield result most quickly. He will realize that
he alone is responsible for the sanitation of the entire village. By
himself, he will never be able to cope with the entire work of sanitation
if people from the village itself do not come forward to help him.
When faced with problems, human beings find out new ways; hence
the English saying: necessity is the mother of invention. As in the
work of sanitation so too in the task of disposal of night-soil it is
difficult to find assistance from the villagers. Let us take the example
of Sindi again. People there defecate publicly in their own courtyards.
The neighbouring fields are surrounded by fences, so these cannot be
used. No one would be prepared to go very far. The village popu-
lation consists of labourers. How can the latter find the time to go to a
distance? How far can the womenfolk go? If so, nothing need be said
of children. Hence, as a last resort, nothing but courtyards remain for
the people to make use of. Villagers are not accustomed to have a
latrine in evey household. Hence so long as there are no  public
latrines in fair numbers or people are not prepared to make their own,
public roads will continue to be used as latrines. In fact, so long as
every individual does not acquire a knowledge of sanitation and he
does not put it into practice, the practice of using roads as latrines,
despite its being unseemly, is perhaps the least harmful from the
hygienic point of view and may be tolerated.
How can a single volunteer living in a village facing such a
situation carry out the work of sanitation? He should set aside a
certain time each day for this task. So long as he is staying there, he
should spend that time in educating the people and keeping the place
clean to the extent that it is possible to do it singlehanded. As soon as
someone is ready to take up the work of sanitation in the locality, he
himself should seek out yet another locality in the same village. If he
is capable enough he should seek the assistance of the district board
and such other authorities for sanitary work. He should find out the
best possible use for the night-soil which accumulates every day. He
may either sell it to the owners of the fields nearby and use whatever
he so earns for further sanitation work in that very area, or, if no one
is prepared to purchase it, he should give it away to any farmer who is
prepared  to  use  the  manure  made  out  of  it  in  his  field  and
demonstrate how useful it is. This is but a trend of thought presented
to the reader. I have not been able to put this idea totally into practice
myself, nor to make others do so. After all this field of work is but
new. Hence, for the present, there can only be an exchange of ideas.
Volunteers who are doing this work will adopt from this whatever is
worth adopting. They will inform me of any drawback in these ideas,
and report to me the experience which they have gained wherever
these have been put into practice.

"i679410","t20180326173451"," THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI C. R. CHAUDHARY)  (a): The benefits under the Startup India initiative are available to all entrepreneurs belonging to any caste, community and gender (including schedule caste/ schedule tribe and women entrepreneurs). Currently, there is no scheme under the Startup India initiative that is administered through banks. Further, The Department of Social Justice and Empowerment is implementing Venture Capital Fund for Scheduled Castes in order to promote entrepreneurship and others among the target population through the Industrial Financial Corporation of India Venture Capital Fund for Scheduled Castes. Till date, an amount of Rs. 240.04 crore has been sanctioned among 66 companies owned by SC Entrepreneurs whereas an amount of Rs. 168.40 crore has been disbursed to 52 companies under the fund. The State wise number of companies'' sanctioned financial assistance till so far is provided at Annexure-I.(b): Startup India supports entrepreneurs from all districts across the country. In order to avail benefits under the initiative, entrepreneurs from any district may apply on www.startupindia.gov.infor recognition of their Startup.(c): Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has constituted a formal mechanism to review the Startup India initiative on a regular basis. A Monitoring Committee chaired by Secretary, DIPP has been constituted for effective monitoring of the implementation of the Action Plan of Startup India initiative. The Monitoring Committee comprises Secretary, DIPP, CEO/Representative from NITI Aayog, Secretary/Representative from Department of Revenue, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Department of Science and Technology (DST), Department of Bio-Technology (DBT), Department of Electronics and Information Technology (Ministry of Communication & Information Technology), Department of Higher Education (Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD)), and CMD from Small Industries Development Board of India (SIDBI). Further, as a constant endeavour to facilitate the Startup ecosystem, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) holds extensive consultations with stakeholders. In various consultations, following concerns were highlighted -  1. Startups were required to submit a Letter of Recommendation (LoR) from organizations such as incubators/ industry associations which often led to undue expenditure and delay for Startups. This discouraged a large number of entities from applying under the programme. 2. Taking into account the long gestation period required by Startups to get established, the period of 5 years as provided in the definition of Startups was too short. Further Startups in bio -technology sector require longer gestation period as compared to others. In order to address the above concerns, following corrective measures have been taken:  1. The requirement of Letter of Recommendation from an incubator/industry association has been done away with both for the purpose of recognition as well as for availing certificate of eligibility for obtaining tax benefits. 2. In order to further promote entrepreneurship in the country, the definition of a Startup has been modified on 23rd May, 2017. It has been broadened to include scalability of business model along with a high potential of employment generation or wealth creation.

"i50663","t19910117583640","I am deeply distressed that hostilities have broken out in the Gulf in spite of all the efforts made to prevent them. The longer the war lasts, the higher will be the toll in terms of human life and suffering. 

I would like to appeal to President Saddam Hussein to announce the commencement of immediate withdrawal from Kuwait, in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolutions. This should be followed by a cessation of hostilities and the resumption of efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. The modalities for it can be worked out by the UN Security Council, which I understand, is already in session. 

I have a message from President Gorbachev about the Soviet initiative in this regard, and we will join them in a common endeavour for peace. We will cooperate actively within the Non- aligned Movement and with all like-minded countries in the joint efforts.

Airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type, free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate. Government has laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDG) with a view to achieve better regulation of air transport services of different regions of the country. It is, however, up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability. As such, the airlines are free to operate anywhere in the country subject to compliance of RDG issued by Government.","minister","ls16","2018","201803","20180308","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2018","294268","338847","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","ShriJayantSinha","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2018","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2018","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2018","l16_nt_2018","bjp_qna_2018","bjp_nt_2018","other","n201803","l16_qna_201803","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","CivilAviation","awhetherthenumberofairpassengersisincreasingeveryyearinGujaratifsothedetailsthereofbthereactionoftheGovernmenttheretoandcthestepstakenbytheGovernmenttoincreasethenumberofflightsinviewoftheincreasingnumberofairpassengersinGujarat","newdelhi",160
"i494206","t20051214238465","  (a) to (c): A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.307 FOR 14TH DECEMBER, 2005. The National Commission on Macro Economics and Health in its recently submitted Report has inter-alia stated that the Medical Council of India (MCI) and State Medical Councils as also the Nursing Council of India (NCI) have failed to carry out the mandate provided to them for regulating the profession and raising the standards of medical education and enforcing them. In this context, the Commission has stated that there is an urgent need to have suitable mechanism to ensure quality in medical education through more stringent regulation for registration and also in registration of medical practitioners after every five years based on the attendance in continued medical education programmes. A number of regulation already exist which provide procedure and norms for establishment of medical colleges, admission of students, qualifications for teachers etc.which prescribe minimum requirement for maintenance of standards in medical colleges. The MCI conducts periodic inspections of various recognized medical colleges to ensure the continued maintenance of standards and in the event of the college not conforming to this minimum requirement, can take action as per the provisions of the Act. Corresponding provision for verification of standards for allowing Institution to start the courses and for maintenance of standards exist in Regulations framed under the Indian Nursing Council Act. In order to ensure effective implementation of various provisions of the Regulations made under IMC Act, the Government is reviewing the entire process of Inspection, including appointment of Inspectors so as to make it transparent and effective. The Government is also examining the issue of renewal of registration of medical practitioners. The requirements of the medical curriculum are also under examination for revision to suit the current needs.","minister","ls14","2005","200512","20051214","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2005","101072","156513","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","smtpanabakalakshmi","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2005","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2005","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2005","l14_nt_2005","inc_qna_2005","inc_nt_2005","other","n200512","l14_qna_200512","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","HealthandFamilyWelfare","awhethertheMedicalCouncilofIndiatheStateMedicalCouncilsaswellastheNursingCouncilofIndiahavefailedtocarryoutthemandateprovidedtothemforregulatingtheprofessionraisethestandardofmedicaleducationandenforcethestipulatedstandardsaspointedoutbytheNationalCommissiononMacroEconomicsandHealthinitsreportbifsothedetailsthereofandthereasonsthereforandcthestepsproposedtobetakentoimprovethestandardofmedicaleducationinthecountry","newdelhi",309

STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.508 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 2. 5.2013 REGARDING COMMERCIALISATION OF WATER SUPPLY.(a) & (b) Several industries are using surface water as well as ground water for commercial purposes as well as for their use after obtaining necessary permissions in respect of surface water from the concerned State Governments / Local Bodies and in respect of ground water from State Ground Water Authority and Central Ground Water Authority. Details in respect of agencies engaged in water supply are not maintained by the Central Government.(c) & (d) The Central Government is concerned about exploitation of ground water, and directions are issued by the Central Ground Water Authority to the State Governments for regulation, control and development of ground water from time to time. Ministry of Water Resources has also circulated the Model Bill to all the States/ Union Territories to regulate and control the development and management of ground water in the State including urban and rural areas in view of declining ground water levels. So far, fourteen (14) States / UTs, namely, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Lakshadweep, Kerala, Puducherry, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Assam, Dadra and Nagar Haveli have modified the Model Bill as per their requirement and enacted the legislation. Fifteen (15) States / UTs, namely, Andaman & Nicobar, Chhattisgarh, Daman & Diu, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have initiated action for enactment of the Model Bill. The Government of Maharashtra has enacted Maharashtra Ground Water (Regulation for Drinking Water Purposes), Act 1993. The Government of Maharashtra has also introduced and passed a Comprehensive Ground Water Bill in the Legislative Assembly to regulate and manage ground water resources in the State. States of Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura have indicated that the ground water development in their States is low and thus they do not feel the need to enact the law. The Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the country and is headed by the Chairman, Central Ground Water Board (CGWB). CGWB periodically carries out ground water assessment of the country. Based on this assessment, the areas are categorised into Safe, Semi-critical, Critical and Over-Exploited categories. The latter is the most water stressed area. Considering the severity of the exploitation and in order to restrict further exploitation of ground water, some of these highly over-exploited areas are declared as Notified for regulation of ground water withdrawal. CGWA so far has notified 162 areas in the country for the purpose of regulation of ground water development. Regulation of Ground Water development in these Notified areas is through district administrative heads assisted by Advisory Committees under the provisions of Section 4 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.","minister","ls15","2013","201305","20130502","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2013","169638","266844","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shriharishrawat","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2013","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2013","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2013","l15_nt_2013","inc_qna_2013","inc_nt_2013","other","n201305","l15_qna_201305","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","WaterResources","awhetherwatersupplyhasbeencommercialisedbyseveralindustrialistsinthecountrybifsothedetailsofmajorcompaniesengagedinthisworkatpresentcwhethertheGovernmentproposestomakeanylegislationtobanrecklessexploitationofgroundwaterintheurbanandruralareasbythesecompaniesinviewoftherecedingwatertabledaybydayanddifsothetimebywhichitislikelytobeimplemented","newdelhi",506

"i499485","t20060512186247","  (a) : The electricity charges for industrial sector are generally higher than that paid by the agricultural and household sector due to cross subsidization of the latter by the former.(b): A statement showing estimated average rates of electricity (updated upto 1. 12. 2005) for different categories of consumers in various states is at Annexure. Under the Electricity Act, 2003, the tariff for supply of power to various categories of consumers is to be determined by the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions and in doing so these Commissions are required to be guided by the provisions contained in Section 61 of the Act which, inter alia, include the factors which would encourage competition, efficiency, economical use of the resources, safeguarding of consumer`s interest and at the same time ensure recovery of the cost of electricity in a reasonable manner and also, reduce and eliminate cross-subsidies. Tariff Policy notified by the Government under the Electricity Act provides that cross subsidies for different consumers are to be reduced and brought within the range of 20% of the average cost of supply by the end of the year 2010-11. The State Government can give subsidy in the tariff determined by the Regulatory Commission, under section 65 of the Act, to the category of consumers it thinks appropriate by paying the amount of such subsidy to the power distribution company. The provision of Electricity Act 2003 and Tariff Policy stated above will protect industrial sector from cost escalation.","minister","ls14","2006","200605","20060512","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2006","103355","161793","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrisushilkumarshinde","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2006","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2006","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2006","l14_nt_2006","inc_qna_2006","inc_nt_2006","other","n200605","l14_qna_200605","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","Power","awhethertheelectricitychargesforindustrialsectoraremanytimeshigherthanthatpaidbyagricultureandhouseholdsectorandbifsothedetailsthereofalongwiththestepstakenbytheGovernmenttoprotectindustrialsectorduetocostescalationofelectricitycharges","newdelhi",246

"i19916","t19320321373805","We should remember that Imam Saheb had set up his home in
English style. Haji Saheba had lived in that style from her very birth.
Fatima and Amina also were brought up like English children. For
one who had lived in this manner, it was extremely difficult to curtail
his heavy expenditure and adopt an utterly simple mode of life. For
Imam Saheb, however, once he had made up  his  mind  to  do  a
particular thing, it was quite easy to  carry  out  his  resolve.  And,
therefore, when I decided to leave Johannesburg and to  settle  in
Phoenix, he himself proposed that he, too, would live there. Though I
knew his firmness of mind, I was completely at a loss what to say in
reply to his proposal. I described to him the hardships of life in
Phoenix. A man who had never put his body to the slightest trouble
and  had  always  lived  surrounded  by  comforts  and  luxuries,  I
wondered how such a person would be able to start forthwith living
like a labourer. Even if he himself could bear the hardships of life in
Phoenix, what about Haji Saheba, and Fatima and Amina, I asked.
Imam Saheb’s reply was brief. He said: “I have put my trust in God.
And you do not know Haji Saheba. She will always be ready to live
where I live, and as I live. If, therefore, you have no other difficulty in
the matter, I have decided to come and live in Phoenix. No one knows
when the struggle will end. I don’t think I shall be able to carry on
my old business of supplying coaches on hire, or take up any other
occupation. Like you, I too have realized that a satyagrahi should give
up love of wealth and possessions.” Imam Saheb’s proposal pleased
me very much. I wrote to my co-workers in Phoenix. They also
welcomed the proposal. And so Imam Saheb and his family came
over.
Many inmates of the Ashram probably do not know that Imam
Saheb joined the residents of Phoenix in all their activities. Everybody
fetched water for his or her own use from a spring below. It flowed at
some depth below the level of the Phoenix Settlement. The Phoenix
buildings were on a hill and one had to climb about fifty feet to reach
the place. Imam Saheb had a delicate constitution even atthat time, but
every morning one saw him walking down to the spring with a kavad1
on his shoulders and climbing up slowly with the buckets filled with
water. The place now occupied by the spinning-wheel in the Ashram
was held in Phoenix by the printing press. All the inmates, boys and
girls, old men and women, educated and uneducated, had to work in
some department of the press. There were all kinds of big or small
tasks, composing, folding the printed copies of the paper, making
wrappers, pasting stamps, moving the wheel with the hand whenever
the machine stopped, etc., etc. Everybody was required to give some
time and help in these tasks, especially on the day on which the
journal was to be published. Imam Saheb, Haji Saheba, Fatima and
Amina, all four of them joined in this work. Imam Saheb had learned
composing. For a man of his temper and habits and of his age, this
was indeed wonderful. In this way, Imam Saheb identified himself
completely with the life at Phoenix. He and the other members of his
family were non-vegetarian, but I don’t remember any time when
they cooked such food at Phoenix.
This, however, does not mean that Imam Saheb was in any way a
less devout Muslim. He never missed namaz, nor did he or his family
ever fail to observe the roza. By adopting the manner of life of the
other  inmates  and  making  a  sacrifice  for  their  sake,  he  really
demonstrated the nobility of Islamic culture.
Imam Saheb’s capacity for self-sacrifice was to be put to a still
severe test. He went to jail again several times, and proved himself a
model prisoner. When, however, in the year 1914 it was decided that
most of the inmates of the Ashram should return to India, leaving
only a few of them in Phoenix, Imam Saheb was put to a real test.
South Africa had practically become his home. Haji Saheba, Fatima
and Amina were complete strangers to India and did not know any
Indian language—a little English and Dutch was all the language that
they knew. But Imam Saheb took no time to come to a decision. He
had made up his mind that he and his family would live wherever I
did. That was his self-sacrifice for the cause of satyagraha and his
contribution towards Hindu-Muslim unity.
All the inmates of the Ashram know about his life after his
coming to India. I am convinced that he was rising higher day by
day:  his  heart  was  becoming  purer,  his  devotion  to  God  was
becomingdeeper and his faith in the Ashram rules also was increasing.
But it is not my intention here to give reminiscences of his life in
India. I should like everybody who came into close contact with Imam
Saheb to write down his experiences, and all such accounts to be put
together with these reminiscences.

"i7428","t19210925531886","I received a letter from the Madras Government the day I
reached Madras. It said:1
I have not sent any reply to this letter. What reply can I give? I
should like to give only one : “I have read your letter. I cannot but
go. You may do what you choose.”
But how can I give such a reply? I have myself suspended civil
disobedience and have asked others to do the same. In an atmosphere
in which people do not know the difference between civil
disobedience and criminal disobedience, how can a man in my
position resort to civil disobedience all of a sudden? With these
considerations in mind, I gave up the idea of sending a reply. I have
in this way let slip an opportunity for winning swaraj which had
presented itself to me, hoping that, in the months still left, people will
grasp the full significance of civil disobedience and we shall be able to
employ it without any fear and so win swaraj for all.

I am writing this article from Trichinopoly.2 Here, I have been
served with one more order, from Pudukkottai State. It is signed by
some English official of the State. I had to pass through the territory
of that State on my way to Chettinad. Fearing that even my passing
through the State might have some influence on its subjects, the
officer writes: “His Highness has come to know that you intend to
pass through his territory. If you attempt to do so, the guards at the
border will turn you back.” I have sent a reply to this. “Received
your letter. I certainly intended to pass through your territory but, in
view of your letter, I shall take another route to Chettinad.”
I, however, regard these to be good omens. If we know how to
use these opportunities, we can certainly win swaraj this year. The
means, too, are quite easy. We should devote ourselves to our work
and then welcome arrest if it comes. We are not yet fit to go to jail. We
have not realized the value of swadeshi and the importance of the
spinning-wheel. How many workers from amongst us ply it regularly
with faith and as a matter of duty ? How many have discarded all their
foreign clothes? Even a blind man can see that the Government
simply cannot tolerate boycott of cloth. It has been employing a
variety of measures to deter us from such boycott.

Students giving up schools and colleges, lawyers giving up
practice, drink-addicts giving up drinking—the Government certainly
dislikes these things, but it may put up with them. It simply cannot
tolerate swadeshi, however. The British came to our shores to trade in
foreign cloth and rule the country to preserve this trade. Foreign cloth
is the heaviest tribute being exacted from us. If we stop paying this,
the Government will cease to be a ruler and will become a servant.

The end of September is nearing. I do not know what progress,
even in Gujarat, boycott has made, and how many spinning-wheels are
in use. I shall not be able to return to Gujarat before October. I hope
that on my return I shall find khadi everywhere, on the persons of all
men and women and in all homes, and shall see a spinning-wheel in
every home.

The Khilafat wound is there, of course, the Punjab wound is still
open; to these is now added the one in Malabar. I am sure that Gujarat
can heal these wounds, if it so wills. It would not be an exaggeration to
say that, to be a witness to its doing this, I have let go the auspicious
opportunity of being in jail. This was one of the reasons for my
forbearance.

"i29920","t19370824675375","DEAR FRIEND,
I thank you for your letter1 of the 17th instant. Evidently I did
not quite understand  what H.  E.  the  Viceroy  said  to  me  about
trans-Frontier. I understood him to mean that he could not think of
permitting me to cross the border. And I accepted what I understood
to be the Viceroy’s decision adding that I did not lose the hope that,
when I have inspired sufficient confidence as to my integrity and
ability, I could safely be permitted to cross the Frontier. But that is
irrelevant to this letter. I would like  to  know  the  implication  of
“leaving all affairs connected with the tribes severely alone” during
my visit. Not that I have the slightest desire to meddle in trans-Frontier
affairs. My intention is, as it was when I first broached the subject to
Lord Irwin2, as Lord Halifax then was, to know the Frontier Pathan in
his own home, to make the acquaintance of Khudai Khidmatgars, to
ascertain for myself how far their claim to be utterly non-violent
could be sustained and how I could promote the general welfare of
the Pathans which is dear to the heart of Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar
Khan. He puts implicit reliance upon my judgment as I put on his
transparency and trustworthiness. But I suppose it is inevitable that
people will come to me to talk about trans-Frontier affairs. Am I not
to listen to their narratives and even give my opinion if I were asked
toexpress it and could form one on what they might tell me? If I
succeed in visiting the Frontier Province, I should certainly feel sorry
if I had to leave it without having the pleasure  of  renewing  the
acquaintance we made during the time you were at Delhi. I await your
further letter about the Khan Saheb’s question.
I just read in the papers the ban has been lifted. I am grateful.
N.W.F.P.

The country is grouped into four seismic zones viz. Zone-II, -III, -IV and V. Of these, Zone V is seismically the most prone region, while Zone II is the least. Broadly, Zone-V comprises of entire northeastern India, parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, part of North Bihar and Andaman & Nicobar islands. Zone-IV covers remaining parts of Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, Union Territory of Delhi, Sikkim, northern parts of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, parts of Gujarat and small portions of Maharashtra near the west coast and Rajasthan. Zone-III comprises of Kerala, Goa, Lakshadweep islands, remaining parts of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and West Bengal, parts of Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhatisgarh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Tamilnadu and Karnataka. Zone-II covers remaining parts of the country.(b) &(c) There is no proven scientific technique available, anywhere in the world, to predict the occurrence of earthquakes with reasonable degree of accuracy with regard to space, time and magnitude. Ministry is not operating any earthquake early warning system and has no proposal to install any such system. However, the National Centre for Seismology (NCS), maintains a country wide national seismological network, to detect and locate earthquakes occurring in and around the country.","minister","ls16","2018","201803","20180307","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2018","262948","338694","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shriyschowdary","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2018","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2018","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2018","l16_nt_2018","bjp_qna_2018","bjp_nt_2018","other","n201803","l16_qna_201803","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","EarthSciences","awhethertheGovernmenthasdividedthecountryinvariousseismiczonesonthebasisofvulnerabilityoftheareatoearthquakeandifsothedetailsthereofbwhethertheGovernmentproposestoinstallearthquakeearlywarningsystemasdistrictlevelandcifsothedetailsinthisregard","newdelhi",255

"i438757","t20020419769833","  (a) Yes Sir.(b) & (c) The objective of the scheme are as under:- i) To give a focussed thrust to setting up of modern apparel manufacturing units of international standards in clusters of excellence which will work as one-stop-shop for reputed international buyers.ii) To give fillip to domestic production to meet competition from imports and to promote exports in this sector. As per guidelines it is expected that the scheme would generate additional employment and would add to exports. The detailed guidelines of the Scheme are attached.(d) Does not arise in view of above. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (B) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.4277 FOR 19-04-2002 GUIDELINES FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF APPAREL PARKS FOR EXPORTS A centrally sponsored scheme titled `Apparel Parks for Exports` has been formulated with a view to involve State Governments in promoting investments in the apparel sector. The Scheme is intended to impart focussed thrust to setting up of apparel manufacturing units of international standards at potential growth centres and to give fillip to exports in this sector so as to achieve the target of US$ 25 billion by 2010 as envisaged in the National Textile Policy 2000 (NTxP-2000). 1. DETAILS OF THE SCHEME  (i) The State Govt.or an Undertaking sponsored by the State Government (the designated agency) will provide land free of cost for establishing the park of sufficient size.(The size of an apparel park may be approximately 150-250 acres but this can be determined in each case on merits).(ii) The location of the apparel park will be such that it is conducive to the establishment of state-of-the art manufacturing units in terms of its access to ports airports rail heads etc.availability of raw-materials and the general level of infrastructural facilities available.(iii) The designated agency will provide infrastructural facilities like power water roads (including approach roads to the park) sewerage and drainage tele-communication & other facilities for the park. Such facilities shall be of high standards to ensure that the units established in the park are able to function efficiently.(iv) The park will have garment manufacturing units with each unit having atleast 200 sewing machines. The park would especially aim at integrated units. It would provide employment to at least 20 000 persons when it becomes fully operational. The park could have the ancillary units like the units manufacturing buttons etc. The park would also aim at having specialised units like processing or washing units to bring more value addition to the garments manufactured.(v) The State Government will also take the initiative in providing flexibility in labour laws in these clusters.(vi) The Central Government will give as a grant 75% of the capital expenditure incurred by the State Government on the infrastructural facilities of the Apparel Park while the remaining 25% will be borne by the agency. This grant shall be limited to a maximum of Rs.10 crores.(vii) The Central Government will also provide a sum upto Rs.5 crores for setting up of an effluent treatment plant creche/s any multi purpose centre/hall for marketing /display etc.(This is being proposed as these facilities are required to enable the units to meet emerging labour/social/environmental standards).(viii) The Central Government will also undertake to provide skill upgradation of the workers employed in the units under its existing schemes wherever possible.(ix) The Central Government will provide grant upto 50% of the cost of any training facility created in the park upto a maximum of Rs.2 crores.(This is being proposed as skill upgradation in garment sector is a continuous process to maintain competitiveness).(x) The State Government may not charge any stamp fee on the sale/transfer of land in this park.(This facility has been given by the Government of Maharashtra for the units being set up in Millenium Park)  2. PROJECT APPROVAL COMMITTEE  (i) The project proposals shall be considered by a Project Approval Committee (PAC) headed by Secretary (Textiles) Advisor (Textiles) Planning Commission AS&FA Ministry of Textiles Textile Commissioner a representative from Department of Expenditure with Joint Secretary Ministry of Textiles as Member Secretary to approve and sanction the proposals received from the agencies for establishment of `parks` to monitor their implementation and to evaluate the progress and achievement under the scheme.(ii) The agencies requesting for assistance under the scheme will prepare feasibility studies and detailed project reports. Only those proposals which are approved will be eligible for assistance under the scheme. While approving the proposal care will be taken to see that the location of the park is conducive to meet the objectives of the scheme.(iii) While considering the proposals due weightage shall be given to the potential of the park for attracting investments employment generation upgradation in technology additionality to exports and creation of labour productive environment. 3. PROJECT FORMULATION: Following points (which are intended to be indicative and not exhaustive) could be kept in mind while preparing of project proposals for setting up of Apparel Parks. Since development of Apparel Parks will have to take into account the peculiar features pertaining to each park emphasis on various items listed hereunder may differ. However it needs to be ensured that the infrastructural facilities provided in the Park are uniformly of high standard.(i) Project Location The locational suitability of the site in regard proximity to international airport/seaport access to railheads etc.existence of an industrial commercial and social infrastructure linkage with hinterland for inputs existence of communication facilities availability of water and power should be guiding factor. State Govt./the designated agency should ensure that location of Apparel Park is primarily guided by the factor that the place is a leading manufacturing trading or export centre of the State. Details should be available of the proposed site especially its area and suitability for industrial development. Normally the land should be under the possession of the State Government / designated agency with clear title thereupon.(ii) Implementing Agency It is expected that implementing agency would have been decided upon before the project proposal is submitted. The status of the implementing agency and its experience in executing similar schemes may be indicated.(iii) Project Description This should indicate both physical and commercial plan: (a) The investments production employment additionality in exports and import substitution likely to be generated by the units to be set up in the park.(b) An appropriate environment management plan to ensure that there is no adverse impact on the environment as a result of setting up of industries in the Apparel Park.(c) Type of infrastructural facilities that are available and/are proposed to be provided.(d) Business Development Plan in a phased manner may also be indicated.(iv) Project Phasing The project report should indicate a realistic time frame within which the different activities would be completed. It may be advisable to execute the project in phases as the demand for plots and other facilities may come up over a period of time.(v) Financing Plan (a) Project cost The fund requirements should be indicated itemwise on all the components of the project which should touch upon basic assumptions made for unit prices physical and price contigencies escalation and annual costs.(b) Project Financing The report should clearly indicate the financing arrangement especially NRI/foreign investment bank loans and also the provisions proposed to be made under the State Plan for this purpose. Approval of the State Government for provision of necessary funds in the plan/budget should be indicated.(vi) Economic Viability It is expected that the parks would be financially self-sufficient in the long run and this point will be given due importance by the PAC.(vii) Socio-economic feasibility report along with environmental assessment should be completed before commencement of the project.(viii) The report shall also include the economic feasibility of the effluent treatment plant which shall be owned managed maintained and run by the implementing/designated agency with the involvement of stakeholders. 4. PRE-ALLOTMENT PROCEDURES:  (i) Scrutiny and assessment formats should be designed and linked up to MIS system by State Govt.through any appropriate agency.(ii) Before commencing the projects or allotment of site care should be taken to ensure the crucial infrastructure like power water and telecommunication are in place.(iii) Business development plan and promotion of Apparel Park should be drawn up simultaneously to avoid under utilization of project.(iv) Provision should be made for additional infrastructure facility like cargo complex ICD custom clearance houses courier and banking services dealing with foreign exchange. 5. MONITORING OF PROGRESS AND RELEASE OF FUNDS:  Since the release of funds by the Central Government will be based on actual financial and physical progress achieved by the park it is essential to institute a mechanism for monitoring the progress of implementation. Instituting a system for monitoring on the lines indicated below could be considered:-  (i) The monitoring of implementation of the Apparel Parks shall be done by Committee at the State Level which would oversee review and report on the progress of the Apparel Park to the Central Government based on which the actual release of funds would be made. This committee will also have representatives from the Centre. The suggested composition of the State Level Committee (SLC) is given in Attachment-I.(ii) The SLC shall meet once every quarter to review the progress and report the same as at Attachment-II III & IV to the Central Government. The quarterly report shall be sent to the Ministry of Textiles by the 7th day of the month following the end of the relevant quarter and (iii) The Central Assistance for each Apparel Park will be released in installments during the Plan period after assessing the progress of Apparel Park at each stage on the basis of reports furnished by the State Government; (iv) All Central assistance will be claimed through the Member Secretary SLC who will furnish itemwise expenditure already incurred before claiming Central assistance in the program at Attachment-III. The State Government should also indicate the other sources of funds including the provisions made in the State Plan. A utilisation certificate as in Attachment-V should also be furnished along with the statement of expenditure. 6. APPROVAL OF UNITS IN APPAREL PARK FOR EXPORTS : The Scheme though a centrally sponsored scheme is implemented and run by the State Governments and hence different approaches are being followed by different States for implementing the scheme and for attracting investment in Apparel Parks. For this reason it is difficult to prescribe a standard procedure for monitoring the socio-economic benefits flowing from the units approved for setting up projects in the Apparel Park for Exports. However to ensure export orientation of the units set up in the Park the following broad guidelines are suggested for consideration of the State Government.(i) The project is thoroughly scrutinized at the formulation stage itself to ensure the possibilities and investments employment and export potential of the proposed site/location.(ii) The State Level Committee (SLC) set up to monitor the implementation of Apparel Park for Exports may also like to address this issue and give necessary directions to the implementing authorities for designing Monitoring formats which can be collected on half yearly basis from the Apparel Parks.

"i497141","t20060301465879","  (a) : Yes, Sir.(b) :Salient features of the scheme for one time settlement of dues payable by State Electricity Boards (SEBs) / Electricity Departments  (EDs) to the Central Public Sector Power Utilities, under which Tripartite Agreement was signed among the State Government, Reserve Bank of India and Government of India, are given in Annexure. All the State Governments have signed the Tripartite Agreement. The scheme covers the outstanding dues payable by the SEBs to the National Thermal Power Corporation  (NTPC), National Hydro-electric Power Corporation (NHPC), North Eastern Electric Power Corporation (NEEPCO), Powergrid Corporation of India Limited.(PGCIL) & Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) under the Ministry of Power, Coal India Limited (CIL) & its subsidiaries and Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) under the Ministry of Coal, Nuclear Power Corporation (NPC) under the Department of Atomic Energy and to the Ministry of Railways. Bonds amounting to Rs.31581 crore have been issued by 27 States. Goa had no outstanding dues. Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi securitized its outstanding dues by way of long-term advances of Rs.3376 crore payable to the CPSUs concerned under Bi- partite Agreement as they do not have power to issue Bonds. ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.1114 TO BE ANSWERED IN THE LOK SABHA ON 01. 03.2006. The Salient features of the Scheme are:  (a)For the states participating in the scheme, 60% of the interest / surcharge on the delayed payments as on 30-09-2001 would be waived off.(b)The rest of the dues amounting to the full principal amount as well as the remaining 40% of the interest / surcharge would be securitised through bonds issued by the respective State Governments.(c)The bonds would be issued through RBI at a tax-free interest rate of 8.5% per annum. The terms of bonds should be structured to achieve a moratorium of 5 years on repayment of principal with the entire principal being repaid between the 6th and 15th year. These bonds would be identical to bonds issued in connection with the market borrowings of State Governments, with the attendant discipline in repayments. The bonds will be subject to lock-in restrictions that will allow release of only 10 per cent of the bonds in the secondary market each year.(d)For ensuring timely payment of current dues in future, defaults in current payment for power/fuel would attract a graded reduction in the supply of power from central power stations and in coal supplies. Where such defaults exceed 90 days from the date of billing, the Ministry of Finance shall recover these dues through adjustment against releases due to them from the Centre.(e)In order to initiate steps towards reform of the sector, the State Governments / SEBs shall accept reform-based performance milestones such as setting up of State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, metering of distribution feeders, improvement in revenue realisation and other such milestones specified in the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Ministry of Power.(f)The States shall be offered incentives for complying with the scheme. If SEBs or their successor entities (other than the ones not owned by the State Government) do not default on their current dues and adhere to the performance milestones, CPSUs shall pay them, during the first year commencing from 1. 10.2001, bi-annual cash incentives equal to 3 per cent of the value of bonds in 2002-03, 2.5% in 2003-04 and 2% in 2004-05 & 2005-06. Further, if SEBs open and maintain Letters of Credit  (LCs) till the end of December 2002, CPSUs shall pay them a one-time cash incentive equal to 2 per cent of the value of bonds. In addition, States undertaking reforms shall also be assisted through Accelerated Power Development and Reform Programme  (APRDP) grants and discretionary allocation of Power. The date for opening of LC`s shall be 60 days from the issue of this letter.(g)The States that withhold their consent beyond 60 days after this scheme enters into force shall be denied any share in the discretionary allocation of 15 per cent from the power stations of CPSUs as well as any assistance under APRDP. If the over dues of such States exceeded Rs 50 crore in respect of any CPSUs, they would also attract reduction in power and coal supplies, as applicable to the States participating in this scheme.(h)Outstanding dues as on 30. 09.2001 would form the basis of the one-time settlement. Dues that accrue after this date would not form part of the scheme. As regard bonds issued in the past in lieu of outstanding dues of SEBs, all bonds issued after 1-3-1998 can be converted into State Government bonds at the option of the respective State Government. These bonds would form part of the scheme. However, any agreements entered in the past of which the old bonds are a part should not be re-opened. Only conversion of bonds under the present scheme shall be permitted.","minister","ls14","2006","200603","20060301","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2006","118866","159449","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrisushilkumarshinde","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2006","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2006","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2006","l14_nt_2006","inc_qna_2006","inc_nt_2006","other","n200603","l14_qna_200603","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","Power","aWhethertheUnionGovernmentandtheReserveBankofIndiasignedatripartiteagreementwithStatesforaonetimesettlementofStateElectricityBoardsduestoCentralUtilitiesandbIfsothedetailsthereofalongwiththelistofStateGovernmentswhichhavesignedthesaidagreement","newdelhi",842

"i51334","t19980101574656","INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING : STATUS AND ISSUES

The process of economic reforms initiated in India in early nineties has focused,
inter alia, on the infrastructure sector especially on attracting private investment.  A
number of policy initiatives have been taken by the Government of India and Reserve
Bank of India (RBI) to attract such private investment. The present paper while listing the
important developments also makes an attempt to focus on some of the important issues
critical to infrastructure financing. The organisation of this paper is as follows: Section 1
deals with the general approach of RBI to infrastructure including link between
infrastructure and Government finance; Section 2 sets out the development in debt
markets which is crucial for financing infrastructure; Section 3 contains the recent
developments and some current issues relating to domestic and external financing of
infrastructure sector. Conclusions are at Section IV.

I. APPROACH OF RBI: A REVIEW

The broad approach of RBI for the development of infrastructure has been
articulated in its Annual Report 1996-97 as follows :

“The financing requirements of infrastructure as a whole are, however, massive and pose
serious problems in the context of the needs to raise more resources both by the public and
private sectors. Currently, the private sector finds regulatory environment and legal as
well as institutional framework non- transparent and complex for its entry. The problem is
compounded by mix-up of the roles as between the owner and regulator in public domain.
These factors in conjunction with the virtual domination of public sector in long term
contractual saving in household sector, and lack of securitisation of debt seem to have
contributed to inadequacies in investment in infrastructure. Injection of resources in public
sector to expeditiously complete the ongoing projects on a selective basis and a more
transparent as well as a definite policy on ownership, regulation and financing to attract
private investor interest, both domestic and foreign, are some of the areas where initiatives
are needed. At the same time, full cost recovery allowing for transparent, and explicit
subsidisation where needed, would make possible adequate flow resources to this critical
area”.

Infrastructure and Government Finances

Recognising the importance of infrastructure, while analysing the Government
finances in the Reserve Bank of India Annual Report 1996-97, it was observed that
“Public outlays on infrastructure, especially in non-tradable sectors such as power and
transport not only complement or ‘crowd in’ private investment by improving the
marginal productivity of capital and thereby enhancing the prospective returns on
investment, but also create forward and backward linkages in the economy, leading to a
multiplier effect on the capital stock”.  The Report also observes that “financing a large
order of infrastructure outlay while exercising prudent control on fiscal deficit would
necessitate, inter-alia concomitant efforts to bring about adjustment in current
expenditures, especially the subsidies”.

With regard to the State Government Finances the Report observes “Given the
accent on infrastructure development, State Governments would need to initiate
appropriate policy changes so as to attract a high order of private sector participation. The
Reserve Bank of India Annual Report 1997-98 further stressed the private initiative in the
financing of key infrastructure sectors.

Role of Financial Institutions in the Development of Infrastructure at Planning Commission, Yojana
Bhavan, New Delhi on November 11, 1998.
I am grateful to Mrs. Usha Thorat, Dr. R.K. Pattnaik and Dr. A. Prasad of RBI for their valuable assistance.

II. DEVELOPMENTS OF DEBT MARKET IN INDIA: REVIEW AND ISSUES

REVIEW

It is important to recognise that central to the development of infrastructure is the
development in debt market in India. The debt market in India comprises basically three
segments, viz., Government Securities Market, which is oldest and most dominant; PSU
Bonds Market, which is basically a development since late `eighties; and Corporate
Securities Market, which is growing fast after liberalisation, especially in the last two
years. The major focus in the development of debt markets has been the Government
Securities Market for three reasons. First, it constitutes the principal segment of our debt
market. Second, as a market for sovereign paper, it has a role in setting benchmarks in the
financial markets as a whole. Third, it is critical in bringing about an effective and reliable
transmission channel for the use of indirect instruments of monetary control.

Early Policy Developments in Debt Market

Since the ‘sixties and until the ‘nineties, the Government Securities market
remained dormant since the Government was borrowing at preannounced coupon rates
from basically a captive group of investors, such as banks. Thus, there existed a passive
internal debt management policy. This, coupled with automatic monetisation of budget
deficit prevented a deep and vibrant Government Securities market. Internal debt
management became an active instrument of policy since economic reform of the
‘nineties. Since the nineties, the Government and the RBI together brought about changes
in instruments and institutional framework in both Government and non-Government debt
markets.

Reform in Debt Markets since 1997-98

Since April 1997, a number of structural and institutional changes in the different
segments of financial markets have been brought about, and these include debt markets,
especially the Government Securities and money markets.

Introduction of Scheme of Ways and Means

Advances to Central Government

As long as automatic monetisation existed, it was difficult to assure a framework
for Government securities market in terms of matching demand and supply through price
mechanism. Hence, the most significant development during 1997-98 has been the
elimination of the practice of automatic monetisation of the Central Government budget
deficit through ad hoc Treasury Bills with effect from April 1, 1997 and the introduction
of a new scheme of Ways and Means Advances (WMA). During 1997-98, special
securities to the tune of Rs.20,000 crore were converted into marketable securities of
varying maturities, in order to augment the stock of marketable securities for active open
market operations. It may be pointed out that during the early part of 1997-98, the RBI
had to resort to sterilised intervention in the management of capital inflows. Also, a
scheme of 14-Day Intermediate Treasury Bills was introduced in the place of 91-Day Tap
Treasury Bills to enable State Governments, foreign central banks and special bodies to
invest their temporary cash surpluses.

Treasury Bills

14-Day Treasury Bills were introduced in June 1997 on a weekly auction basis.
Thus, investors now have the option to invest in 14-Day, 91-Day and 364-Day Treasury
Bills.

Uniform price auction in respect of 91-Day Treasury Bills has been introduced as
an experimental measure. Uniform price auction method is expected to eliminate the
problem of winner’s curse and encourage more aggressive bidding in the primary market.

To foster market clearing rates in the primary market and bringing about more
transparency in auctions, the RBI is now pre-announcing notified amounts in auctions of
Treasury Bills (14-Day, 91-Day and 364-Day) and dated securities.

In India, State Governments are major non-competitive bidders who have large
and volatile surplus funds positions and these render the pricing pattern and allotment of
bids uncertain for competitive bidders. As another measure towards a more effective
market clearing price, non-competitive bids are now kept outside the notified amount.

Retailing of Government Securities

The Reserve Bank of India has been actively trying to promote retailing of
Government securities. First, a system of primary dealers and satellite dealers was set up
and liquidity support from the RBI has been made available to them. Secondly, the RBI
announced special liquidity support for dedicated gilt funds. However, not much interest
has been evinced in this channel so far. Thirdly, banks are now allowed to freely buy and
sell Government Securities on an outright basis and retail Government securities to non-
bank clients, without any restriction on the period between sale and purchase. Fourthly,
with a view to enabling dematerialisation of securities of retail holders, institutions such as
National Securities Depository Ltd. (NSDL), Stock Holding Corporation of India Limited
(SHCIL) and National Securities Clearing Corporation Ltd. (NSCCL) have been allowed
to open SGL Accounts with the RBI.

Strengthening Dealers System

The RBI has recently enlarged the number of PDs from 6 to 13 by announcing ‘in-
principle’ agreement to register 7 PDs. The addition of 7 more PDs is expected to increase
activities in terms of liquidity and depth both in the primary and secondary markets.

Investment in Central Government Securities by FIIs

To widen the participants in the debt market, including Government securities,
foreign institutional investors have also been permitted to operate, though such
participation had to be consistent with overall ceilings on external commercial
borrowings.

Ready Forward Transactions

In our market, two types of repos are currently in operation – inter bank repo
including PDs and the RBI repo which is used for absorption/injection of liquidity. After
the irregularities in securities transactions in 1992, inter bank repos are permitted under
regulated conditions with eligible participants and instruments being generally restricted
and now expanded gradually.

In order to further expand the base in the inter bank repos market, the participation
was extended to non-bank entities that had already access to call money market as lenders.
Repos have also been permitted in PSU bonds and private corporate debt securities
provided they are held in dematerialised form in a depository and the transactions are done
in recognised stock exchanges.  This will be operationalised after Government issues a
clarification regarding applicability of stamp duties on dematerialised instruments.

In the most recent monetary and credit policy, the RBI removed the restriction of a
minimum period of 3 days for inter bank repo transactions. This would further enable
banks and other participants in the repo market to adjust their liquidity in a more flexible
manner.

In recent months, open market operations of the RBI, both through outright sales
of Government Securities and repo operations have gained considerable momentum. At
present, the RBI conducts three-day and four-day repos in the market. RBI is also
exploring the possibility of conducting one day repos. The primary objective of these
operations is to absorb or provide liquidity from/to the market, though under certain
circumstances, repos have also been used to signal changes in interest rates.

ISSUES

Since the introduction of the reform measures, the various segments of the
financial market have responded favourably and become increasingly integrated. Although
significant progress has been made in the debt markets also, a number of rigidities persist
and major issues still need to be tackled keeping in view a consistent framework.

The actions required for this purpose may be classified into areas relating to legal,
technology, regulatory and market microstructure, retailing, standardisation, risk
management etc.

Legal issues

Repeal and Replacement of Public Debt Act

A new legislation titled the Government Securities Act proposes to repeal and
replace the Public Debt Act, 1944. The Government Securities Bill has already been

approved by the Cabinet and is awaiting Parliament clearance. However, since the Public
Debt Act, 1944, is applicable for marketable loans raised by the RBI on behalf of both the
Central and State Governments, the proposal requires consent of all State Governments.
The State Governments have to pass a Resolution for the purpose either prior to enactment
by the Centre or subsequently adopt the same by passing a Resolution. Once the new Act
is enacted, the RBI will have substantive powers to design and introduce an instrument of
transfer suited to computer environment. The new Act will also give flexibility to allow
Government Securities to be held in Depositories while at the same time specifically
excluding Government Securities from the purview of Depositories Act, 1996.

Amendments to Securities Contracts

(Regulation) Act, 1956

It is held that rescinding the 1969 Notification restricting forward trading in
securities is now necessary for the development of the securities market. Simultaneously,
there is a proposal to amend the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (SCRA) to add an
enabling provision to provide jurisdiction to the RBI also in the regulation of the debt
markets. With this, the respective regulatory roles of SEBI and RBI in the debt market will
be formalised. The proposed changes in the SCRA will pave way for a more active repos
market and introduction of new market features like, when-issued trading.

Stamp Duty Reform

Development of financial markets is being inhibited by multiple prescriptions of
stamp duty which is creating friction in active secondary market trading by increasing the
transaction cost and administrative hassles. This is a matter of crucial importance and
exemption of debt instruments from stamp duty or alternatively rationalisation of the
procedures by imposing a flat fee would go a long way in increasing secondary market
activity and liquidity in debt instruments. The suggestion that the Indian Stamp Act be
amended to enact a specific provision exempting transactions of all securities in
Depository in dematerialised form from stamp duty also needs to be seriously considered.

Technology

Technological upgradation in Debt Market

The RBI has embarked upon the technological upgradation of debt market. This
includes screen-based trade reporting system with the use of VSAT communication
network complemented by a centralised Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) accounting
system. It will be integrated with the regional current account system. The
operationalisation will broaden the participation in the auction system, help enlarging the
investor’s base and increase the competitiveness in the auction system. The centralised
SGL accounting system will improve the speed of settlement of secondary market
transactions.

The operationalisation of VSAT by end of December 1998 will provide on- line
linkages between offices of RBI, Central Government (Ministry of Finance), monitoring
of Government finance (receipts and expenditures) and also among other participants
(banks/primary dealers/satellite dealers/financial institutions). This will open new areas in
technological development of payment systems.

Y2K Compliance by Primary Dealers and Satellite Dealers (System Software and
Hardware) with the target date December 1998 as also being monitored.

Electronic Dealing System

The RBI is actively coordinating with the Primary Dealers Association in
developing an Electronic Dealing System to facilitate dealing in call, notice and term
money, Treasury Bills, Government Securities and repos. This is expected to be
operationalised by March 1999.

Regulation of Private Placement

There is an increasing recourse by corporates to private placement of their debt
paper. This popularity of private placement may be attributed to the low issuance cost,
ease of structuring instruments, saving on time lag in issuance. Notwithstanding these
benefits, healthy development of the private placement market calls for more
transparency, better disclosure and protection of investors’ interest.

An Informal Group on Primary Market under the Chairmanship of Dr. Shankar
Acharya has recommended that the facility of private placement should be restricted to not
more than 99 qualified institutional investors and should be tradable on OTCEI. The
Group also recommended that financial institutions/banks/mutual funds which participate
in private placement should mandatorily give information on a regular basis to SEBI and
the RBI.

Standardisation of Practices

Standard practices in the market need to be evolved with regard to the manner of
quotes, conclusion of deals, etc. Code of best practices has to be evolved for repo
transactions. It is proposed to ensure that the Primary Dealers Association and FIMMDAI
quickly set up a time frame for standardising the documentation and market practices and
if need be the RBI will come forward and indicate a time frame. Most importantly, the
code of conduct will have to be compatible with the contemplated dealing screen and the
technological upgradation.

Risk Management and Development of Rupee Derivatives Market

Introduction of rupee derivatives will go a long way in providing instruments for
investors to hedge their exposures. The Reserve Bank has decided ‘in principle’ to create
an environment that would facilitate introduction of interest rate swaps. The RBI proposes
to examine in consultation with market participants, relevant aspects such as standard
documentation, benchmark rate, prudential prescriptions, etc., and then allow the product
in the market.

With the amendment to SCRA, 1956 and the establishment of a strong clearing
house, the introduction of T-Bills Futures can be contemplated. The RBI is already
encouraging trading in Government securities through National Securities Depository Ltd.
and National Securities Clearing Corporation Ltd. By allowing them to open SGL
Accounts with the RBI. A committee is also looking at STRIPS in the Government
Securities market.

Development of a Benchmark Rate

RBI recognises the importance of benchmark rate but is of the view that any
benchmark rate needs to be developed by the market itself.  In the interest of market
development it is prudent that market participants themselves work out unitedly and come
out with a reference rate. Recently, the NSE has evolved a benchmark rate linked to call
money which has been quite popular with some debt issuers.

New Instrument Development

Recognising the need and importance of new instrument in the debt market
Reserve Bank of India had constituted an internal working group to examine the Pros and
Cons of implementing STRIPS. The Committee is expected to submit its Report within a
month’s time.

Encouragement to Trade Through Mark-to Market

It has been the RBI’s endeavour to ensure that banks increasingly mark their
investments to the mark. Accordingly, the ratio of investments in permanent category has
been brought down to 30 per cent for March 1999. In the next three years, the intention is
to mark the entire portfolio to market. New private sector banks are already required to
mark to market their entire investments from end-March 1997.

Flexible approach to market borrowings of the State Government

Currently, all the market borrowings programme of all States is conducted by RBI
at a common fixed coupon and tenor in two or three combined tranches. While some
States feel that they could get a better deal from the market if they go to the market on
their own, others are skeptical about their capacity to market without a common tranche.
As a long term objective, each State should in RBI’s view, have freedom to complete the
approved programme on its own market standing. As a sequel to consensus in a meeting
of RBI with the State Government Finance Secretaries it has been decided in consultation
with Government of India, to initially implement a flexible approach to State Government
market borrowings. According to this approach, the State Governments have the option to
borrow from the market on their own standing, to the extent of 5 per cent to 35 per cent of
their approved borrowing programme. During the current fiscal two State Governments
have opted for this; hopefully, during fiscal 1999-2000, the scheme will be implemented
by more State Governments.

State Government Guarantees

An issue that has significant implication in the context of infrastructure financing
is the guarantees given by the State Governments. Governments grant guarantees to
promote certain economic enterprises for reducing the credit risk for investors especially
in those activities or arrears where the nature of investment is characterised by long
gestation period. While guarantees do not form part of debt these have in the eventuality
of default, the potential of exacerbating even an apparently sound fiscal system. In view of
this, Reserve Bank of India has raised its concern in its Annual Report 1997-98. RBI as a
prudent central bank has been emphasising on prudential limits and transparency in regard
to formal guarantees as well as letters of comfort that have the effect of guarantees. A
Committee has been constituted by the Reserve Bank of India with a few of the State
Finance Secretaries as members to examine various aspects of guarantees and the
Committee is expected to submit its Report in a month’s time.

III. FINANCING OF INFRASTRUCTURE

Institutional Developments

Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation (IDFC)

As a sequel to the recommendation of the Expert Group on Commercialisation of
Infrastructure, IDFC has been set up to promote infrastructure investment with the Central
Government and Reserve Bank as chief contributors of share capital.  IDFC began
operation in December 1997 and was fully capitalised in March 1998.  The main task of
IDFC is to connect projects and institutions to financial markets in a manner that has not
been possible before and, by so doing, develop and nurture the creation of a long-term
debt market. IDFC would not just be another term lending institution or merely a credit
enhancer but its mandate is also to perceive and meet the gaps in policies, procedures, and
system that enable economical and efficient infrastructure financing.

The funding structure of IDFC was deliberately designed to ensure private
ownership and professional management, though largely funded by public sector. The
Government of India and RBI have provided subordinated debt of Rs.650 crore and initial
capital of Rs.350 crore.

Bank lending for infrastructure

In order to promote and strengthen the infrastructure financing, Reserve Bank has
liberalised the term loans by banks for this purpose. Earlier, there were prudential ceilings
on the overall exposure that banking system could take on a single infrastructure project.
These have been removed recently. Each bank is now free to sanction term loans to all
projects within the overall ceiling of the prudential exposure norms prescribed by the
Reserve Bank, viz., 25 per cent of the capital funds in the case of an individual borrower
and 50 per cent in the case of borrower group. The Group Exposure norm of 50 per cent is
also allowed to be exceeded up to 10 per cent provided the additional exposure is for the
purpose of financing infrastructure projects. Further, banks are given freedom to decide
the period of term loans keeping in view the maturity profile of their liabilities.

It is necessary for RBI to be assured that, the banks ensure that given their short
term liability structure, their exposure to long term asset is kept within prudential limit. As
the debt market develops depth and liquidity, the asset liability mismatch that banks face
on account of financing infrastructure can be managed through development of derivatives
products. Further, the limitation of exposure norms can be handled through development
of credit derivatives. Such credit enhancement products also help in adoption of
consortium approach and ensure that special skills required for infrastructure financing
which may be limited, would be used efficiently.

Informal Meeting on Infrastructure Financing

Recognising that infrastructure development is a national priority, Governor,
Reserve Bank of India has been having since December 1997, periodic interaction with
financing institutions, and select banks with a view to accelerating the pace of
implementation of infrastructure projects in key sectors by adopting a problem solving
approach.  The objective of these discussions has been to set-up a mechanism to review
sector specific issues on an on-going basis so that viable projects which are at an advanced
stage could be brought to financial closure early. The broad topics which were covered in
seven of these meetings held so far are as follows : Hedging mechanisms for foreign
exchange loans; Quantum of domestic financing for infrastructure projects (past and
future); Mechanisms that will help to catalyse financing; and Domestic financing for
infrastructure.

Domestic Financing of Infrastructure

In the context of the domestic financing of infrastructure project, it is important to
recognise the quantum of domestic debt for financing these projects and the mechanisms
that would help to catalyse infrastructure financing. According to available information
the amount sanctioned for infrastructure projects during 1997-98 amounted to Rs.22,255
crore. However, the amount disbursed has been Rs.6,505 crore. As per the estimate
worked out by IDFC, the total funds required for infrastructure projects for the next four
years would be Rs.1,63,900 crore of which domestic debt requirement would be Rs.56,734
crore. Of the total domestic fund requirement indicated above IDFC expects that
commercial banks support would be around Rs.16,000 crore over the next four years.

It is Reserve Bank’s endeavour to facilitate flow of resources of the magnitudes
indicated by IDFC. Reserve Bank of India has to reckon the fact that banks are the
principal repositories of household savings and consequently recognise the liquidity and
interest rate risk faced by them in using short term liabilities for long term financing.
Ultimately the development of a deep and liquid debt market with diversification of
investor base will help in evolving products that can help banks manage such risk and
unbundle the credit risk from the liquidity and interest rate risk. All efforts are being made
by Government of India and the RBI to facilitate the development of debt markets. RBI
wishes to encourage banks and institutions to securitise the receivables, repackage and
offer to investors at various stages of the infrastructure project. The immediate hurdle,
however, appears to be the current applicability of stamp duty.

One of the specific proposals made for hedging liquidity risk and interest rate risk
is a take out facility and market making in project debentures, say after a pre-determined
period of five years to give comfort to commercial banks which are willing to deploy their
funds in infrastructure. While RBI encourages the take out facility which could be
replicated in several projects, RBI will have to monitor the extent of such facilities in
relation to the balance sheets of the parties. In any case, the provision of a “liquidity back
stop” by RBI for supporting market making at the end of the pre-determined period has
implications for monetary management.

External financing of infrastructure

The current policy of Government on External Commercial Borrowings is to allow
substantial flexibility in case of power and other infrastructure projects. It has been held,
however, that the use of external financing for infrastructure is being inhibited by the
inability to hedge long term exchange risk under current regulation of RBI. While RBI has
been taking several measures to deepen the forward market in foreign exchange, there is
limited forward supply beyond one year. Long term currency swaps have been used
though in a limited way and the market participants have also been encouraged by RBI to
run a swap book subject to prudential limits. In cases where there is a natural hedge such
as export oriented units or where there are foreign exchange receivables the exchange risk
issue does not inhibit external financing. Indian commercial banks with overseas branches
have also been entering into long term reciprocal arrangements with institutions like
HDFC and HUDCO which have availed of external assistance by using the foreign
currency funds at their overseas branches and providing rupee finance in India. True,
banks are encouraged to run swap books as long as the prudential norms are complied
with and a few of them have intermediated such swaps. Financial institutions are
encouraged to do such swaps as long as the counter parties are their clients.

Two specific proposals have been made to get around inadequate hedging
opportunities for long term exchange risk. These are analysed :

Long term exchange swaps : This envisages raising of long term funds and overseas
placement of these funds at Indian banks’ overseas branches and avail rupee finance there
against from the bank in India.

In this case the borrower has to bear the cost of the difference between the rate at
which the funds are raised and that earned on the funds deployed with the overseas
branch. It is expected that the interest on the rupee funds would cover such differential and
still be sufficiently competitive.  The structure is possible only to the extent the overseas
branch is able to absorb such foreign currency funds. While such swaps have been put in
place even earlier, the broader prudential issues relating to bloating of balance sheets,
capital adequacy and exposure norms have to be sorted out before advocating large scale
recourse to this method.

Over borrowing to meet redemption : The proposal is that the project will raise an
amount higher than required and the excess borrowing will be held as a deposit overseas
for the duration of loan which is expected to be 30 years. The reinvestment of the interest
would result in redemption value becoming equal to the principal of the loan. The
exchange risk on the principal is thus automatically hedged. The interest rate risk and
exchange risk on the interest payments would need to be borne/managed by the project.
Further, the proposal assumes the overseas bank would be willing to accept the
deposit/liability for a period as long as 30 years; secondly, if the borrower is not able to
raise funds for longer period than 10 years and is not able to roll over at the end of 10
years at reasonable credit spreads, RBI should provide foreign exchange to enable
continuation of the deposit up to 30 years.

It is necessary to recognise that in this proposal, there is an element of addition to
the total external debt of India beyond what is repatriated to India. Once the external
borrowing is approved by the Government of India for 10/30 years period, given India’s
policy and procedures as well as track record, there is no question of non availability of
foreign exchange at the time of redemption. The real issue is, perhaps, raising rupee
resources for the remaining period of 20 years. When there is inability to rollover external
loan after ten years, if rupee resources are raised to meet such a contingency, foreign
exchange can certainly be acquired from the market.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion we recognise that investment in infrastructure is critical. Financing
requirements are large and of long term nature. While seeking arrangements for
enhancement of financing flows, measures should be consistent with the state of financial
market and prudential requirement.

As explained, we in RBI have been making best efforts in this regard, and we are

"i605543","t20130805033823","  (a) As per UNCOMTRADE data, Indias share in global agricultural trade is 1.67% during 2011. Indias share in world agricultural trade is relatively low. The small share is primarily on account of very high domestic consumption, low land holding size, low productivity, constraints of supply chain and marketing linkages as well as low level of processing. Moreover, essential commodities including foodgrains are allowed to be exported only after meeting the buffer stock and strategic reserve norms.(b) The quantum of export and import of major agricultural products during last three years including current year upto May, 2013 for top five destinations are at Annexure-I and Annexure  II respectively.(c) In July, 2008, the Tunisian side had sought relaxation of the ban on export of rice. The Government receives requests from time to time for supply of Indian agricultural products from various countries and also during the bilateral trade negotiations such demands are also being raised.(d) The export of agri and allied products has registered considerably high growth rates i.e. 32.03%, 68.36% and 30.59% during last three years in rupee terms.(e) No specific study has been conducted to access the total potential of export of agricultural sector in recent times. Encouraging exports is a continuous process. The Government is taking steps to encourage exports of agro products through measures and incentives under Plan schemes of the Commodity Boards and Export Promotion Councils. Besides these measures, the Ministry of Commerce & Industry has put in place various schemes namely Market Development Assistance (MDA), Market Assistance Initiative (MAI), Assistance to States for Developing Export Infrastructure and Allied Activities(ASIDE), Vishesh Krishi and Gram Upaj Yojana, Focus Product Scheme, Focus Market Scheme, Town of Export Excellence, etc.to provide assistance to encourage exports.","minister","ls15","2013","201308","20130805","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2013","145058","267855","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","drdpurandeswari","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2013","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2013","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2013","l15_nt_2013","inc_qna_2013","inc_nt_2013","other","n201308","l15_qna_201308","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","CommerceandIndustry","awhetherIndiasshareintheglobaltradeinagriculturalproductsisverylowandifsothedetailsthereofandthereasonsthereforbthequantumofagriculturalproductsimportedaswellasexportedduringeachofthelastthreeyearsandthecurrentyearitemwisecountrywisealongwithforeignexchangeearnedthereoncwhethertheGovernmenthasreceivedanyrequestsfromvariouscountriesincludingTunisiaforthesupplyofagriculturalproductsandifsothedetailsthereofdwhetherthecountryhasnotbeenabletooptimallyutilizethepotentialforexportofagriculturalproductsandifsothedetailsthereofandthereasonsthereforandewhethertheGovernmenthasconductedanystudytoassessthetotalpotentialoftheagriculturalsectorintheexportandifsothedetailsthereofalongwiththestepstakenbeingtakenbytheGovernmenttoboosttheexportofagriculturalproducts","newdelhi",297

Ministries/Departments have been requested to ensure strict compliance of these austerity instructions.","minister","ls14","2005","200507","20050729","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2005","79308","149113","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrsspalanimanickam","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2005","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2005","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2005","l14_nt_2005","inc_qna_2005","inc_nt_2005","other","n200507","l14_qna_200507","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","Finance","awhetherthearrearsofwealthtaxincometaxcentralexcisedutyandNPAshaveincreasedovertheyearsbifsothepercentageofincreaserecordedseparatelyineachofthelastthreeyearscthereasonsthereoftogetherwithstepstakentobringdownthearrearsdwhetheritisafactthatmanyoftheprojectshaveeitherbeenscrappedornottakeninhandbecauseofpaucityoffundsandeifsothestepstakentobringeconomyinGovernmentexpenditure","newdelhi",682

"i15365","t19290627395752","The belief that anything old is good is a source of numerous
wrong practices. If all that is ancient is considered good what about
sin? It is very old, but it will ever deserve to be discarded. Untouchability
is also old, but it is a sin, therefore we should give it up. The
same is true of drinking and gambling. If a thing which lies within the
province of reason…which can be proved to be right or wrong with
the aid of reason, does not appeal to reason, it would deserve to be
immediately given up.

However old purdah may be, reason cannot accept it today. The
harm it has done is self-evident. We should not try to justify purdah as
we do in the case of many other things by putting an ideal
interpretation on this custom. In fact the way it is now observed, it can
stand no such interpretation.

The truth is that purdah is not an external affair, it is something
internal. Many women who observe purdah externally are found to be
immodest. However, a woman who retains her modesty without
observing external purdah deserves to be worshipped. And fortunately
there is no dearth of such women in the world even today.

In the scriptures we find many terms which had an external
meaning at one time but which are interpreted at present anaogically.
One such is yajna. Now we know that the killing of animals is not a
true yajna. True yajna consists in burning up the animal passions
within us. One can quote hundreds of such examples. Therefore those
desirous of reforming and saving Hindu society need not be afraid of
ancient conventions. We cannot find better principles than the old
ones. But the way they are to be put into practice must continue to
change. Change is a sign of growth while stagnation is the beginning
of decay. The world changes every moment. Only the dead do not
change. Immobility is thus a sign of death. We are not talking here of
the immobility, the calmness of the yogi. In the calmness of the yogi
there lies hidden the speediest motion. There is in that calmness the
utmost wakefulness of the atman. We are talking here of inert
immobility…in other words, of inertia. Enslaved by this inertia we are
driven willingly to acquiesce in all old evil customs. It prevents us
from making any progress. This very inertia comes in our way in the
attainment of swaraj. Now let us see how the purdah causes us harm.

1. It prevents women from receiving education.
2. It makes them timid.
3. It ruins their health.
4. It comes in the way of normal relationship between men
and women.
5. It engenders in them a sense of inferiority.
6. Women lose contact with the outside world and as a result
they are deprived of their due experience.
7. It prevents a woman from performing her role as man’s
better half.
8. Those women whose observe purdah cannot play their full
role in the struggle for swaraj.
9. Purdah comes in the way of children’s education.
Considering all these ill effects, it is the duty of all intelligent
Hindus to do away with this evil custom.

As with the other reforms so also with the purdah. Charity must
begin at home. When others observe the good results of our actions,
they will naturally emulate our example. It is, however, important to
remember one thing: A reformer must always be gentle and
courteous. If in doing away with purdah our aim is observance of
restraint, then it is our duty to take this step and we will surely succeed
in our effort. But if what we aim at is not restraint but licence, it will
not be possible to remove the purdah, because the public will then
resent the move and in anger may even support this evil custom. The
people are pure in their hearts and cannot respect a movement with an
impure objective.

As per WTO database, Indias share in global commercial services exports was 3.2% from 2012 to 2014.(c), (d) & (e): Services sector has emerged a key driver of Indias economic growth contributing substantially to Gross Value Added, employment & trade. The sector plays a vital role in the success of Make in India initiative. Further, the surplus on services exports finances more than 50% of merchandise trade deficit. In view of the important role played by the services exports in our economy, Government of India follows a multi-pronged strategy for enhancing services exports. These include negotiating meaningful market access through multilateral, plurilateral and bilateral negotiations, trade promotion through participation in international fairs/exhibitions and focussed strategies for specific markets and sectors. Further, there are domestic sectoral challenges and difficulties. These are identified and sought to be addressed through consultations with stakeholders. Government of India also provides some fiscal benefits through Services Exports from India Scheme (SEIS) for some identified sectors as per budget availability. These initiatives are expected to enhance services exports from India.","minister","ls16","2016","201608","20160808","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2016","223019","314815","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","independentcharge","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2016","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2016","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2016","l16_nt_2016","bjp_qna_2016","bjp_nt_2016","other","n201608","l16_qna_201608","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","CommerceandIndustry","athedetailsofexportsofservicesduringthelastthreeyearsandthecurrentyearbthecontributionofservicesectorexportstotheGrossDomesticProductanditsshareinglobalexportsofservicesduringthesaidperiodcwhethertheGovernmenthastakenorproposestotakestepstomakeIndiaaglobalserviceshubdifsothedetailsthereofalongwiththestepstakenbytheGovernmentinthisregardandetheextenttowhichitislikelytoimproveIndiasshareinglobalexportsofservices","newdelhi",314

"i83540","t20200611237138","Namaskar!! I hope you all are in your best spirits!! Serving the country continuously for 95 years is indeed a big thing for any organization. ICC, Indian Chamber of Commerce has contributed to the development of East India and North East, especially to the manufacturing units there. It is indeed historic. I congratulate every dignitary here who has contributed for the ICC.

Friends, ICC has witnessed India's fight for independence since its formation in 1925. It has witnessed the severe famine and food crises and has also been a part of India's Growth Trajectory.

Now this time the AGM is happening at a time when our country is fighting against multiple challenges. The whole world is fighting against the coronavirus; India too is fighting, but other types of challenges are also constantly cropping up.

Somewhere there is a challenge of flood; somewhere we are facing the problem of locusts; somewhere hailstorms are creating havoc while somewhere there is a fire in the oil-fields or a series of minor earthquakes. And on the top of it back to back two cyclones hitting the coastal states of the eastern and the western regions posed a real challenge.

We are all fighting together on all such fronts. More often than not time also tests us. Sometimes many difficulties and challenges arise together.

But we have also seen that in such situations, our attitude guarantees a bright future. How we are dealing with a challenge and how strongly we are fighting against the difficulties determines the opportunities to come.

Friends, there is a saying here - मन के हारे हार, मन के जीते जीत, that is, our willpower and determination charts our path forward. The one who already accepts defeat gets fewer opportunities before him. But he who strives for victory and moves ahead, supporting each other, more opportunity comes in front of him.

Friends, our solidarity, the spirit of facing the biggest disasters together, our determination and our willpower are the greatest strength as a nation.

The panacea for any difficulty is staying strong. Tough times have strengthened the determination of India every time and have energized and boosted the resolution of the countrymen as a nation. I can see the same feelings on your face today and in the efforts of crores of countrymen. The crisis of Corona remains all over the world. The whole world is fighting it. Our country is fighting it with the help of Corona Warriors.

But amidst all this, every countryman is now also filled with the resolve to convert this disaster into an opportunity; we have to make it a big turning point for the country.

What is this turning point? Atmanirbhar Bharat, Self Reliant India!! This spirit of self-reliance has been lived by every Indian like an aspiration for years.

But still there has been a major wish in the mind of every Indian - I wish we were self-sufficient in the field of medical equipment! I wish we were self-sufficient in defence manufacturing! I wish we were self-reliant in the coal and minerals sector!

I wish we were self-reliant in the fields of edible oil and fertilizers! I wish we were self-reliant in electronic manufacturing! I wish we were self-sufficient in Solar Panels, Batteries and Chip Manufacturing. I wish we were self-reliant in the aviation sector. These countless wishes and desires have always shaken every Indian.

Friends, this has been a major reason why in the last 5-6 years, India's goal of self-reliance has been paramount in the policy and practice of the country. Now the Corona Crisis has taught us a lesson on how to speed it up. It is from this lesson that the 'Atma Nirbhar Bharat campaign has been born.

Friends, we see that in the family too, when a child, son or daughter, turns 18-20 years old, then we say learn to be independent and self-reliant. In a way, the first lesson of self-sufficient India begins with family. India will also have to be self-reliant.

Friends, the 'Atma Nirbhar Bharat' campaign simply means that India should minimize its dependence on other countries. We should learn to manufacture within India everything that the country is forced to import. How can India become an exporter of those products in the future, we have to work fast in this direction.

In addition, we also have to regulate the import of those things or products that are made by India's small entrepreneurs, our artisans, handicrafts artisans, and millions of poor associated with our Self-Help Groups, which are being manufactured and sold here for decades. We have to control the trend of getting the same goods from abroad.

With this practice, we will not only buy things from these small entrepreneurs, we will not only give them the money, but will also be, in a way, rewarding their hard work and will be showing them respect. We do not even know how much this gesture impacts their heart and how proud they feel!

Therefore, now is the time to be ‘vocal for your local’. It is time to make every village, every town, every district, every state and the whole country self-sufficient.

Friends, Swami Vivekananda once wrote in a letter- The simplest method to be worked upon at present is to induce Indians to use their own produce and get markets for Indian art ware in other countries. The path shown by Swami Vivekananda ji is an inspiration for India in the post Covid world. Now the country has pledged and the country is also taking steps.

The major reforms announced under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Campaign are being fast implemented.

Whether expanding the scope of definition of MSMEs or arranging thousands of crores of special funds to support MSMEs, these are all becoming a reality today. Be it the decision related to IBC, the decision to decriminalize minor mistakes or the formation of Project Development Cells for Fast Tracking of Investment, many such works have already been done.

Now to make various sectors more competitive, especially Coal and Mining, the industry must come forward to take full advantage of the reforms that have been announced. The young friends should also come forward.

Friends, the decisions made recently for the farmers and rural economy have freed the agricultural economy from years of slavery. Now the farmers of India have got the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country.

The amendments that have been made in the APMC Act, Essential Commodities Act, have opened the path of partnership between farmers and industry. It is sure to revive the farmer and the rural economy. These decisions have identified the farmer as a producer and his produce as a product.

Friends, whether it is the decision to transfer money directly to the bank accounts of the farmers, whether it is the decision of MSP or their pension scheme, our effort has been to empower the farmers. Now farmers are being helped to grow into a big market force.

Friends, the cluster based approach for Local Products which is now being promoted in India is also an opportunity for everyone. Whatever is produced in the districts and blocks, related clusters will be developed nearby. For example, jute based industries will be strengthened nearby for the jute farmers of West Bengal.

Modern processing units will be made available close to the tribal companions who are collecting vast wealth of forest produce. Besides this, clusters will also be made for Bamboo and Organic Products. The entire North East, like Sikkim, can become a major hub for organic farming. An organic capital can be developed.

Organic farming can become a huge movement in the North East if all the traders associated with ICC are determined. You can make a global identity and can dominate the global market.

Friends, all of you have been working in North East and East India for so many decades. All the steps the government has taken will be of great benefit to the people of East and North East.

I think Kolkata itself can become a very big leader again. Seeking inspiration from its old glory, Kolkata may in the future lead the development of the entire region.

Who knows better than you about the pace with which this region can grow with the help of labour, property and resources of the east!

Friends, after 5 years, i. e. in the year 2025, your organization is going to complete its 100 years. On the other hand, in the year 2022, India will complete 75 years of independence. This is the best time for your organization, for each of your members to make a big resolution. I urge you the ICC to also set 50-100 new targets at its level for the 'Atma Nirbhar Bharat campaign.

These goals should also be of the institution, of every industry and business unit associated with it and also of every person. The more you move towards your goal, the more this campaign will progress in East India and the North East.

Friends, we have to revive Bengal's historic superiority in manufacturing. We have always been listening to ""What Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow"", we have to seek inspiration from this and we have to move forward. This is the time to move the Indian Economy from Command and Control to Plug and Play. This is not the time for Conservative Approach, but it is time for Bold Decisions and Bold Investments.

It is time to set up a Globally Competitive Domestic Supply Chain in India.

For this, the industry has to help all the stakeholders of its existing supply chain to come out of the crisis and also their hand-holding in value addition.

Friends,

Moving forward with the Atma Nirbhar Bharat campaign and struggling with the Corona period, the topic of People, Planet and Profit that you have raised in this AGM today also holds immense importance. Some people think that these three are opposite to each other, and are contradictory, but it is not so. People, Planet and Profit are interlinked to each other. All three can simultaneously flourish and co-exist.

Let me give you some examples such as that of LED bulbs. 5-6 years ago, an LED bulb was available for more than Rs 350. Today the same bulb is available for up to 50 rupees. Just Imagine! Lowering the price of LED bulbs has helped it to reach crores of houses all over the country and these are now being installed as street lights. This quantity is so large that it has reduced the cost of production and also increased the profit. Who has benefited from this?

People have benefitted. The common man has benefitted with a lower electricity bill. Today, about Rs 19 thousand crores are being saved every year by the people due to lower electricity bills, thanks to LEDs. These savings have benefited the poor and the middle class of the country.

The Planet has also benefited from this. The LED bulbs sold by government agencies at a lower price alone have reduced the emission of about 40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year.

That is, both have profited; there is a win-win situation for both. If you look at other schemes and decisions of the government too, then this concept of People, Planet and Profit has been more strongly implemented on ground in the last 5-6 years.

Now you too have seen how much the government has been emphasising upon Inland Waterways. Waterway from Haldia to Banaras has been commissioned. Now waterways are being extended to the North East as well.

People benefit from these waterways, because it reduces the cost of Logistics.

Planet also benefits from these waterways, because it burns less fuel. And we should not forget that it will reduce the import of petrol and diesel and reduce traffic on the road.

Goods will be cheaper and will reach the destination via the shortest route quickly. Both the buyer and the seller have profit in it.

Friends, there is another campaign going on in India - to free the country from single use plastic. All the three subjects i. e. People, Planet and Profit are being addressed here.

It is very beneficial, especially for West Bengal. This increases your chances of growing Jute's business here. Have you taken advantage of it? Have you started making packaging material with jute? In a way, you are at the greatest advantageous position.

You should take advantage of this opportunity further. If you leave this opportunity, then who will help you? Just imagine! When the Jute bag made in West Bengal will be in the hands of everyone, then how big the profit will be for the people of Bengal!

Friends, Approaches of People Centric, People Driven and Planet Friendly Development have now become a part of Governance in the country. Our technological interventions are also compatible with the idea of People, Planet and Profit.

Through UPI, our banking has been Touchless, Contactless, Cashless and 24 into 7. Transactions through BHIM APP are now creating new records. RuPay card is now becoming the favourite card of the poor, farmers, middle class and every section of the country. When we talk of a self-reliant India, why not use the RuPay Card with pride?

Friends, now the scope of banking service in the country has also reached those people, who were kept in the category of Have-nots for a long time. Through DBT, JAM i. e. Jandhan Aadhaar Mobile, it has been possible to deliver the necessary support to crores of beneficiaries without leakage.

Similarly, Government e-marketplace, ie GeM, has given people an opportunity to earn profit by connecting with the government. You are aware that small self help groups, MSMEs, can provide their Goods and their services directly to the Government of India on the GeM platform. Otherwise, an entrepreneur with a turnover of few lakhs could not think of selling any goods he had produced directly to the central government.

Therefore, I also urge the ICC to motivate your members and the associated manufacturers to join GeM in maximum numbers. If every manufacturer connected to you will join GeM, then small businessmen will also be able to sell their products directly to the government.

Friends, when we talk about Planet, you are also observing that today ISA, I. e. International Solar Alliance is becoming a big global movement. Efforts are being made to share the benefits that India sees for itself in the field of Solar Energy with the whole world. I request all the members of the Indian Chamber of Commerce to extend their Contribution and Investment towards the Targets set for Renewable Energy, Solar Power Generation in the country.

Invest in R&D and manufacturing of better Batteries to increase the power storage capacity of the Solar Panel in the country. You can do Handholding of MSMEs, and other such institutions, that are engaged in this work. In the changing world, Solar Rechargeable Batteries is going to be a huge market. Can Indian industry lead it? India can become a huge hub in this area.

The ICC and its members can set targets on these subjects by linking them to the years 2022 when India will complete 75 years of its independence and 2025 when the ICC will complete its hundred years.

Friends, this is the time to recognize the opportunity, try your mettle and move towards new heights. If this is the biggest crisis, then we should take full advantage of it, while taking the biggest lessons from it.

I assure you that the government is fully committed to this objective and is with you. Feel free to move forward, with new resolutions. Move forward with a new confidence!! At the root of self-reliant India is self-confident India.

Gurudev Tagore has said in his poem 'Nooton Juger Bhor' - ""Cholai Cholai Bajbe Joyer Bheri, Paer Begei Poth Kete Jaay Korish Na Ar Deri"", i. e. ""Every moving step will be declared. The feet running forward will create a new path. Don't delay now"".

Just imagine how big this mantra is - moving feet will create a new path. When such a big inspiration is in front of us, there is no question of stopping.

I am confident that when you celebrate 100 years of your establishment, when the country celebrates 75 years of its independence, our country would have moved forward on the path of self-reliant India.

STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION No.640 REGARDING DIGITAL TELECAST FOR ANSWER ON 9. 5.2002.(a) to (c): Five (5) Doordarshan channels are presently being uplinked in digital mode and these signals are available through satellite in the entire country. Prasar Bharati has no scheme to start Digital telecast throughout the country in terrestrial mode. However Doordarshan is setting up digital terrestrial transmitters at Delhi Kolkata Chennai and Mumbai for starting experimental service. The main advantages of Digital Terrestrial Transmission as compared to analogue transmission lie in its superior quality of audio & video signals; multi-channel operation; mobile reception and less transmission power requirement. The transmitter at Delhi has been installed and is presently under testing. Transmitters at Kolkata Chennai and Mumbai are expected to be installed during 2002.","minister","ls13","2002","200205","20020509","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2002","41896","103529","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","smtsushmaswaraj","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2002","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2002","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2002","l13_nt_2002","bjp_qna_2002","bjp_nt_2002","other","n200205","l13_qna_200205","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","InformationandBroadcasting","awhetherDoordarshanisplanningtobeamdigitaltelecastcountrywisebifsothebenefitslikelytobederivedtherefromandcthetimebywhichdigitaltelecastislikelytobeintroduced","newdelhi",155

"i679366","t20180326033800","  (a) Government has taken several steps to enhance exploration & production of oil and gas and promote clean alternative fuels in order to reduce imports of crude oil. In order to increase domestic production, a number of policy initiatives have been taken which include inter-alia Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy (HELP) and Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP), Discovered Small Fields (DSF) Policy, gas pricing reforms with premium for difficult areas, grant of marketing freedom for gas produced from difficult areas, National Seismic Programme for unappraised areas, National Data Repository, easing out rigidities in the existing Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) and transparent and clear policy for grant of extension under the PSC regime. Government has also taken a number of initiatives to encourage the use of alternative fuels such as Ethanol and Bio Diesel and promote the conservation of petroleum products. Some of the important achievements/initiatives in these areas include inter-alia award of 30 hydrocarbon bearing contract areas under DSF Policy, launch of bids under OALP for 55 oil & gas blocks, approval of 40% capital grant under Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga to promote gas based economy, improvement in the supply of ethanol, direct sale of bio-diesel to all consumers for blending with High Speed Diesel and setting up of 2 G ethanol plants.(b) The prices of petrol and diesel have been de-regulated with effect from 26th June, 2010 and 19th October, 2014 respectively, barring prices of PDS kerosene and subsidized domestic LPG. Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies decide on the prices of finished products in line with the changes in the international markets. Prices of PDS kerosene and subsidized domestic LPG prices continue to be modulated by the Government, in order to insulate the common man from the impact of rise in international crude prices and the domestic inflationary conditions and the consumers continue to get these products at subsidized rates. The prices in the domestic market are uniform for these petroleum products, produced either from imported or domestic crude oil.(c) Oil marketing companies - private and public - export petroleum products to various countries. 65.51 Million Metric Tonnes (MMT) and 56.26 MMT of petroleum products were exported during 2016-17 and April17 to January18 respectively.","minister","ls16","2018","201803","20180326","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2018","279190","341679","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","SHRIDHARMENDRAPRADHAN","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2018","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2018","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2018","l16_nt_2018","bjp_qna_2018","bjp_nt_2018","other","n201803","l16_qna_201803","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","PetroleumandNaturalGas","awhethertheGovernmentproposestoincreasetheoilminingandintroducealternatesofcrudeoiltoreduceitsimportandifsothedetailsthereofbwhethertheGovernmentregulatesthepriceofpetroleumproductsproducedfromtheimportedcrudeoilandcrudeoilproduceddomesticallyindifferenttariffsandifsothedetailsthereofandthereasonsthereforandcwhetherthepetroleumproductsproducedfromthedomesticcrudeoilareexportedtoothercountriesandifsothedetailsthereof__________","newdelhi",371

MURLI MANOHAR JOSHI AND SHRI RAJENDRASINH RANA REGARDING NUCLEAR POWER GENERATION  (a) The share of nuclear power in energy mix is country specific and is based on the electricity demand, availability of energy resources, technological and industrial capability etc. Currently, 436 nuclear power reactors are in operation in 31 countries and 61 reactors are under construction in 14 countries globally. Nuclear power contributed about 13.5% of total electricity generation in the world in the year 2011. Most of the developed countries continue to pursue nuclear power programmes to meet their electricity requirements. Among developed countries, there are 16 reactors under construction - ten in Russia, three in South Korea and one each in France, Finland & USA.(b) Indias electricity demand is huge and growing. All energy sources including nuclear power are being deployed optimally to meet the countrys growing demand. Nuclear power is a clean energy option and has vast potential to provide long term energy security. It would therefore be an important component of the countrys energy mix.(c) The share of nuclear power in the total electricity generation in USA, UK, China and Russia in the year 2011 was 19.2%, 17.8%, 1.8% and 17.6% respectively.(d) The share of nuclear power in the total electricity generation in our country in the year 2011-12 was 3.7% and the installed nuclear power capacity was 4780 MW. The Integrated Energy Policy envisages reaching a nuclear power capacity of about 63,000 MW out of the total 7,78,000 MW capacity required for a GDP growth rate of 8% by the year 2032. The share of nuclear power in the year 2032 is expected to be of the order of 10%, depending on generation from various sources in that year.","minister","ls15","2012","201204","20120425","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2012","208996","245831","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrivnarayanasamy","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2012","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2012","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2012","l15_nt_2012","inc_qna_2012","inc_nt_2012","other","n201204","l15_qna_201204","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","AtomicEnergy","awhethernuclearpowersectorisgivenlesserimportanceforpowergenerationinthedevelopedcountriesallovertheworldbifsothereactionoftheGovernmenttheretocthepercentageofpowerbeinggeneratedfromnuclearsectoroutofthetotalquantumofpowergeneratedinUSAEnglandChinaandRussiaanddthepercentageofpowertargetedtobegeneratedfromnuclearsectorinthecountry","newdelhi",329

"i32319","t19390805068658","GANDHIJI : If you are a satyagrahi, I too am a satyagrahi, and as I
have been told by many friends that you are a reasonable man and a
man of restraint, I shall show you that you are wrong.
Well then, you ought to have exhausted all the constitutional
means. You must remember that the Bombay Congress Ministry is
under four Congress Committees—Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka
and Bombay. You should have lodged your complaint before them.
Failing satisfaction you should have gone to the Working Committee,
failing there to the A.I.C.C., and then to the open session of the
Congress. And if you accept my authority as an expert in satyagraha,
then you should have come to me, but not with a decision to fast.
SATHE: I do not accept you as the final authority, but I would certainly take
your advice. But let me ask you one question. Whether all these Congress Committees
give an opinion in my favour or not, what if the Ministers say they have violated the
Yes. But they will not resign, they say, unless they are asked to resign. But
they have broken the promises given in election manifestos.
There is no rigidity about the manifestos. You may say many
things but you may not be able to carry them all out.
My own Sadashiv Peth, which is one of the constituencies, did resolve that the
Ministry had not fulfilled the promises.
Well then, let that committee approach the A.I.C.C. But why this

The natural steps take years. It is a cumbersome machinery.

I do propose to go to the open Congress, for the Congress is an authority
above you.
I am no authority. I have a certain amount of moral influence.
But you do not exercise it.
How do you know?  You must place all the facts before me and
convince me that I have not done all in my power.1
But you do not expect me to express my judgment on these matters?
I do.
How can I? Your reading out the texts of orders to me and
placing all the facts in your possession before me does not take me
further. I must hear the Ministers also.
But that you can easily do. You are the High Command.
You have said that the Ministers’ resignations are in your pocket.
When did I say so? Produce my statements.2
No, seriously, if I made any such preposterous statement, it
would be bravado. You do not find my name mentioned anywhere in
the constitution. I can exercise my moral authority certainly, but that
only when I see that there is something which ought to be done
(morally) by the Working Committee or the Ministry.
Then you will study the case while I go on with my fast.
How can you, when you have yet to convince me of the justi-
I am fasting only to arrest your attention.
You will if you do not fast. The moment you begin your fast
you distract my attention, you paralyse my capacity for unbiased
judgment. I could not enjoy my meals if I knew that someone was
fasting without cause. And then you must know that this is a colony of
fasters. There is Bhansali, the greatest faster I have known, Vinoba had
fasted, and so has Kakasaheb. You had better see them, talk to them,
and see if they approve of your going on fast.3

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
I do not take your view. If we have a national government,
and we have papers that simply thrive on prosecutions, what are   we to
do? But that  only  means  that  there  are  fundamental  differences
between us. We have got to examine everything. If you want me to use
my moral authority, I must have certain conviction   that the Ministers
have gravely erred in all the three matters you have mentioned. And if
the conviction goes home, I would certainly like to speak to the
Ministers and the Working Committee. But to do all this I must exa-
mine your allegation at leisure. And you may be sure that though I
have very little time I would study the papers you send me, just for
your sake.
But in the mean while I may fast.
No.  You  can  place  the  whole  case  before  the  Working
Committee if you like.
Everyone has a right. The Working Committee is there to listen
to every Congressman and non-Congressman with a grievance. But
now that you have asked me to study the case perhaps you may not
want to put it before the Working Committee. After I have given my
decision, you may reason with me, plead with me, and then if you find
me obstinate, you can fast against me.
You are a student of the Gita?
I am.
Well then, I tell you your fast would be the third kind of tapas
described in the seventeenth chapter1—tamasa tapas  born of ignorance
and perverseness.
So I may fast a month hence, if I am not satisfied?
Yes, but if I want more time, you will give me.

Further, - 2 - distribution of PDS kerosene within the State to the ration card holders through ration shops/retailers is controlled and supervised by the State Government. Public Sector OMCs have reported that based on the inspections conducted by them and reports received from respective District/State Authorities, 90 cases of irregularities like adulteration, black marketing, diversion, pilferage and other irregularities in distribution of PDS kerosene were detected during the last three years and current year (April-September, 2015). During this period, 3 kerosene wholesalers were terminated for irregularities such as diversion/black marketing of kerosene. The State-wise and OMC-wise details of irregularities detected and action taken thereon for last three year and current year (April-September, 2015) is at Annexure-I and II respectively.(c) : State-wise details of the per capita allocation and consumption of kerosene in the country during each of the last three years and the current year are at Annexure-III and Annexure-IV respectively. The variation in the per capita allocation is on account of historical allocation, difference in LPG coverage etc. The scale of PDS Kerosene allocation to beneficiaries under various categories such as Antyodaya Anna Yojana, Below Poverty Line is done by the State/UT Governments. The Government allocates PDS Kerosene to States/UTs including the State of Gujarat on quarterly basis for distribution under PDS for cooking and illumination only. Further distribution within the States/UTs through their PDS network to various categories of ration card holders as per their respective criteria, is the responsibility of the concerned States/UTs. In response to the requests of various State Governments for increased allocation of PDS Kerosene, the Government has allowed the States/UTs to draw one month quota of PDS Kerosene at non-subsidized rates during each financial year w.e.f.2012-13 for special needs.(d) & (e) : Government of India intends to implement Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme in kerosene in 25 Districts identified by the State Governments, on a Pilot basis.","minister","ls16","2015","201512","20151207","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2015","236901","301454","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","independentcharge","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2015","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2015","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2015","l16_nt_2015","bjp_qna_2015","bjp_nt_2015","other","n201512","l16_qna_201512","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","PetroleumandNaturalGas","athedetailsofadulterationdiversionblackmarketingandpilferageofkerosenefromvariousStatesunderPublicDistributionSystembyorganisedgangpersonsinthecountrybifsothedetailsofcasesofirregularitiesreportedduringthelastthreeyearsandthecurrentyearandactiontakenbytheGovernmentagainstthepersonskerosenedealersinvolvedinsuchmalpracticesStateUTOMCwisecwhethertheStateGovernmentshaverequestedforincreasingtheSuperiorKeroseneOilSKOandifsothedetailsthereofalongwithpercapitaPDSSKOallottedandconsumedinthecountryduringthesaidperiodalongwiththereasonsforvariationreductioninpercapitaallocationofPDSkeroseneamongvariousStatesparticularlyforweakersectionsofAntyodayaAnnaYojanaandBPLbeneficiariesStateUTwiseincludingGujaratdwhethertheGovernmentproposestostartDirectBenefitTransferDBTschemefortransferofkerosenesubsidydirectintotheconsumersaccountandeifsothedetailsthereofandthetotalamountofsubsidybeingtransferredinthecountryatpresentalongwithanyassessmentconsultationsmadewithStateGovernmentsinthisregardtoextendtheschemethroughoutthecountryandreductionofsubsidyamountasaresultthereofStateUTwise","newdelhi",365

I thank you for the address and the purse.It is a matter of very
great joy to find that this is the birth place of Mr. Srinivasa Sastri. As
you very properly say, he is one of the greatest sons of India. I have
been asked to announce to you that the library is to be opened very
shortly. I have been asked also formally to declare that library open
from this place. I do so with the greatest pleasure. And I hope that all
the old and young men will contemplate that noble life and try as
much as is possible for every one of you to follow him in his lofty
patriotism, sense of duty and in his untiring zeal. Service to the cause
of the country is his motto. May you also learn to be true servants of
the country.

I observe that there is a fair Muslim population here. I hope that
you have always peaceful relations amongst yourselves. We Hindus

"i6711","t19201024318363","The “All-India Home Rule League” will henceforth be known
as “Swarajya Sabha”. Its constitution has been changed. I must
confess that I always disliked the term “Home Rule”. If we are to
know even our highest ideal under a foreign name, why not have it as
our ideal to turn ourselves into foreigners? I know some highly
educated Indians who believe that India’s salvation is possible only
through immitation of Western ways and ideals. One of these Indians
is Mr. Chintamani1. I respect Mr. Chintamani. It is not that he does
not love India. If, in most things, he prefers the Western way, it is not
for self-interest. Somehow he feels that only by turning ourselves into
their like shall we be able to meet the English as their equals. Some
Indians, converts to Christianity, believe that the country’s salvation is
impossible until both Hindus and Muslims have become Christians.

However, just as we would not have it as our ideal to turn
ourselves into Englishmen or Christians, so also I did not like the
phrase “Home Rule”. The meaning, the force, to be found in
“swaraj” are not present in “Home Rule”. Hindus and Muslims,
all—even illiterate people—can understand the term “swaraj”, but not
“Home Rule”. We have, therefore, dropped Home Rule and given to
“swaraj” its rightful place.

Besides this, there are other important changes which are worth
noting. The aim, so far, was to secure Home Rule within the British
Empire, like what the Colonies enjoy. Instead, the aim now will be to
strive for swaraj of people’s choice. The means have always been a
subject of controversy and, therefore, we have limited ourselves to all
effective means which are peaceful and legitimate. That is to say, the
ideal now before us is to achieve swaraj without recourse to violence.

The Congress is the people’s organ. The Homr Rule League
has always worked as a subsidiary body of the former and the
Swarajya Sabha will do the same. For the present, therefore, swaraj
has been defined to mean what it means in the Congress constitution,
the implication being that the Swarajya Sabha will also strive to get the
Congress constitution changed.

In my view, these changes are unexceptionable, and were
necessary too. The intention behind them is sincere. They have been
made after much thought and discussion. A committee consisting of
Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, Shri Rajagopalachari, Shri Omar Sobani, Shri
Jinnah, who is president of the Bombay Branch [of the All-India
Home Rule League] and Shri Jayakar2 was appointed to draft a
suitable constitution. The draft was discussed in plenary sessions,
once in Calcutta and a second time in Bombay, and the constitution
was adopted by a majority vote.

Despite this, some lawyers and other friends have resigned from
the Swarajya Sabha. Signatories [to the letter of resignation] include
men who have enjoyed a high reputation right to this day. I have
been pained by these resignations, and still more by the reasons given
in the letter. The help these friends gave was highly esteemed by the
Swarajya Sabha. Even so, when basic ideals are in question, one has to
part from one’s dearest friends and be happy in doing so.

Let us now consider the letter of resignation. We shall first
examine the charge against me. Mr. Jinnah had argued that no
amendment would be valid unless approved by a three-fourths
majority. In support of this, he argued that under the old constitution
the council of the Home Rule League could make any change by a
three-fourths majority. I ruled that the restriction placed upon the
council by the general body of the Sabha did not apply to the Sabha
itself. The general body had the common right of taking decisions by
simple majority and this was not nullified by the restriction placed on
the council. I still adhere to this ruling. I do not think it necessary to
enter into a discussion of the adjectives which Shri Jinnah and his
friends have used to describe my ruling.

However, thinking that Shri Jinnah’s view, which was supported
by Shri Jayakar, deserved the utmost consideration, I consulted other
lawyers. They have endorsed my view and said that I could have
given no other ruling, that it would have been arbitrary of me to have
given a ruling other than the one I gave.

The second reason which they have given for resigning is that
the Swarajya Sabha has shown contempt for the Congress constitution.
This is certainly not true for, as I have pointed out above, we have
accepted the Congress definition of swaraj pending a change in its
constitution.

The third charge is little serious. Shri Jinnah and his friends
have stated that the clause defining the means to be employed for
winning swaraj lends itself to the interpretation that it permits the
Swarajya Sabha to carry on unlawful activities. To an extent, this
interpretation is correct for, in my view, the means [as defined] cover
civil disobedience. I think it necessary to retain this freedom. It is not
always easy to say what is constitutional or legal. Some people argue
that non-co-operation is illegal. Some others used to argue that civil
disobedience was illegal. The means clause is so drafted as to give
some freedom with view to avoiding occasions for such controversies.
The clause does not mean, however, that the Swarajya Sabha will
encourage any and every kind of violation of law. The provision that
the means must be peaceful rules out incivility in any form. The
clause is intended to ensure that there is no difficulty in our adopting
any means we consider necessary so long as we remain civil.

I have shown that there is nothing improper in the constitution
of the Swarajya Sabha. Why, then, have all these leaders left it?
The simple answer is that the country is moving so fast now that our
leaders cannot keep pace with it. In such circumstances, no matter how
much we are pained we must go ahead. India will not have such an
opportunity for a century. We may only hope that when the leaders
realize the value of the strong popular current, they will not hesitate to
join it. Our duty, meanwhile, is to follow our chosen path with due
civility, to bear with the leaders’ differenes with us, to maintain respect
for them and, undeterrred by their disagreement, go ahead firmly,
calmly and with full regard for moral principles. Truth comes to no
harm.

"i50950","t19930916508085","IT GIVES ME great pleasure to be here at the inauguration of IT ASIA, 1993 which promises to be a major show piece of India's achievements in the field of information technology. We are living today in the ""Age of lnformation""-an era in which the relative strength of nations and of enterprises is determined less by differences in the physical wherewithal of power and more by access to and management of information. The tremendous pace of technological change over the past two decades has created a situation in which the effectiveness and efficiency of physical assets are being conditioned by the ability to anticipate and adapt rapidly to changing conditions. India today stands at the cross-roads of history. The sweeping economic reforms carried out by the Government over the past two years, which shall be carried even further in the near future, are only at best enabling measures. They set the environment and the ""rules of the game."" Whether the country actually moves forward and becomes an economic giant or slides hack and gets relegated to an also-ran depends upon the rapidity with which the tools of international competitiveness are adopted and utilised by Indian entrepreneurs to take advantage of the opportunities, that have been opened up and meet the challenges, that have been thrown up. The highly protective nature of the Indian economy in the past had insulated the country to a large extent against the winds of change that were sweeping through the international markets, mainly as a result of the communication and informatics revolution. Indian industrial and services sector were slow in the adoption to these new technologies. There were no compelling reasons for our entrepreneurs to adopt competitive strategies which had been developed for meeting the needs of a buyer's market. But things are changing. As the Indian economy opens up and starts to get integrated into the global economy, our ways of doing business will have to change. In this process, the role of the information technology sector will be crucial. The Government too will have to change its methods of functioning in order to keep up with the requirements of a liberalised economy. The policy changes, that have taken place have attracted the attention of foreign investors towards India. The conversion of our intentions into reality will depend upon the extent to which we are successful in changing the image of the country from a nightmare of bureaucratic red tape to a vision of efficiency and investor friendliness. The multiplicity of forms, documents and approvals has to be reduced and streamlined. In a country of the size of lndia, this cannot be done without recourse to such information technology devices as 'wide area network' and 'electronic data interchange,' whereby a single form should be sufficient to provide all necessary information to every concerned government agency simultaneously. Decision making can then proceed in parallel, and not sequentially, as at present. I Such an administrative system requires not only new technologies,. but . also a change in attitudes, not only a change in attitudes but change in skills. People, who are just about two years from their retirement, it will be rather atrocious to ask them to learn anything new. You will have to change them over in orientation rather than the process of learning. At the other end where we have the recruitment going on, that is where the person's mental horizons and the capability to accept new things, to absorb new things for the coming 25 years, that will have to be built at this stage. Now these are the things easily said, but when we really try taking steps to build them into the system, I am sure we are going to face lot of problems. We are facing them already but we are also able to plan and at the same time we will have to start facing them SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT so that five or six years from now, we are in a position to perfect our requirement processes to the stage where they become really resilient . enough to accept anything new that is coming in the coming years. That in short is what we describe by the ability to manage change,to absorb change, to turn change to our advantage and not become a slave to change or a victim of change. Now, this is the difference. If you don't become the one, you will become the other. So, it is a question of mastering the change, it is a question of giving a direction to change the way you want it and not just yourself change as the direction really pushes you. So, this is what we have to do. From the government side, from the business side, from every side, this will have to be tackled. I don't expect this to be very easy but I don't expect it to prove impossible either. We have enough originality, enough adaptive skills in this country to make them possible. Information technology is a vast field encompassing a wide range of technologies addressing different applications. The earlier distinction between the electronics information media, such as radio and television, data-processing system such as computers, and telecommunications, no longer holds good. Recent advances in technology and approaches have started to bring about a convergence of these fields or an integration of these fields where one is connected with the other. They all work like a team rather than an individual as a computer or a TV or a video or anything. We know all these things get integrated into single units. The power and impact of the traditional media have been enhanced many times over by digital processing techniques. Similarly, mainframe computers are making way for distributed processing systems, which are a combination of computers and high speed communication systems. This process will soon reach its logical conclusion when multi-media systems, incorporating audio, video and data-processing interactivity, become affordable and eventually get linked up with personal communication systems. am also apprehending that you will be flooded with so much information that the real question will be to pick and choose. Now  you don't know what to take, what not to take, what to reject, and day in and day out you will be rejecting hundred times more than what you will be expecting and in that also there could be human errors. And you can imagine the horrendous results of errors occurring in the adaptation, acceptance and rejection of data which is available to you. So, this again is going to be the new problem for which our young men and women would have to be trained. It is just like some kind of instinct being developed. You just know what is good for you, what is to be selected and you just know what is not to be selected. In 99 per cent cases you prove right. From 40 you go to 99 and that is the training you will have to receive, that is the learning you will have to do, our young men will have to do, on the job. I don't see any escape from this because when you get something in excess of what you can manage, there is always the question of rejection, there is the question of discarding, accepting these, questions are coming, and these questions themselves are intricate. Therefore, you can only learn on the job by committing a few mistakes, maybe, but then ultimately if you put-the young man or a woman puts his or her heart and soul in the job-I think, it will be easy ultimately to become so instinctively correct, accurate that you will hardly make a mistake. This is what happens in many walks of life. You don't really go to a dictionary to find out whether the spelling of every word is correct. I am giving you a very ordinary example. You remember it, you have read it somewhere, you are absolutely certain that this is correct and the other is not correct and in most cases you are right, maybe, in one or two cases you are wrong. There are momentous developments and we need to adapt to them. It is, indeed, fortunate that despite the limitations of the user sectors, the information technology industry in India has progressed to the extent that it is state-of-the-art in many areas and is growing stronger everyday. For a poor country where technologies have to be used not because of our economic position but because of our necessity, there is no warning which needs to be given. I have seen, we have SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT all seen, in recent years that there is craze for up gradation. Every year, everything gets upgraded. I think this has been carried to an extent which perhaps a poor country cannot stomach. I use one package of word processing. For years the upgrades are coming and when I look into the literature of what the upgrade means over what has been there in the past year, I find very little difference. Either it has become a fashion or a habit or a business tactics. I think we should be careful about these things. You skip four upgrades, maybe the fifth will be really useful to you. It will mean a real upgrade. Pardon me, saying so. This has happened to me, this is my own experience and I am sure, it is the experience of everyone of you. Between Upgrade-4 and 5, there is really nothing, just a few keys being changed and that is it. And that is being sold as a matter of fashion. 'Oh! you are still having Upgrade-4, I am having Upgrade-5.' Please be careful about these things. While the tool is good, don't become so tool-oriented that you lose your identity. You have the right to find out what the tool is like, is it good, is it bad or is it better or is it worse. It is your decision. The tool should depend on the version of the user and not of the manufacturer or someone who is really trying to fog it off on you. So, one has to be very careful in this subtle salesmanship that takes place most of the time. Whenever people think of India in the context of information technology, there is a tendency to think only of our software capabilities. This is undoubtedly a matter of pride, but it is also somewhat limited. The technological capabilities of our computer hardware industry have improved significantly in the last few years. The time-lag between international technology levels and that prevailing in the Indian computer industry has shortened dramatically from over ten years or so in the 1970s to a few months or even days at present. It is a source of great pride that India was one of the first few countries in the world to unveil, I-486 based computers. Now I am told, it is 586. I wanted to know what the difference is. While coming here, I was putting questions what is the difference between 486 and 586 apart from the speed and so on.  But still I am to get full information to make a judgement. I may even say that let me wait for 686 and carry on with 486 in the meanwhile.  But I am sure, when you are convinced that there is something definitely ofan advantage, definitely superior, definitely useful-it will be superior to some extent in the speed perhaps. But if it is superior in functions, functionally superior, and those parts of the functional superiority which you consider necessary for you could be in functions which don't make any difference to you as a user. But if they do make difference, a whole lot of difference, then you say yes 5 86 is definitely superior and more useful and I must go in for it. That is the final thing. The bottom line is: Do. you want to go in for it and spend. the extra money? So, these upgrades and later versions can confuse people to some extent. This is only the start. The design capability of Indian hardware engineers is at par with the best in the world. In diverse fields of hardware design, such as parallel computers, transaction automation, networking and communication systems, Indian products are making their presence felt. It is only a matter of time before this capability is translated into a substantial global presence. The experience of the parallel supercomputer development in the country is a case in point. This programme began in order to develop indigenous capability for meeting our strategic ,and developmental needs primarily in response to external pressures. Today, there are a number of independent efforts, which have become successful to a considerable degree and the internal competitive pressures are driving each develop er to higher levels of excellence. With further efforts in developing application software for these super computers and greater marketing thrust, India can become an exporter in this highly competitive and technologically intensive field. There is considerable scope for alliance between the various governmental research agencies and the private sector in this endeavour. Exports of software have grown steadily and rapidly for the past ten years at annual growth rates of over 45 per cent in dollar SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT terms. There does not appear to be any slackening in the growth performance, and software exports are targeted to cross the US $ 1 billion mark by 1996-97. This is also no mean achievement. The sector is now firmly ensconced in the firmament of major software sources of the world. I am told that India has become the most preferred source for offshore software development for a number of foreign companies. But success brings its own problems. Various hurdles are being placed in the way of our software exports activity in some of the major markets. Changes in visa requirements and taxation treatment are putting pressure on the on-site software development activities of Indian software companies. The more pressures are put on you, I come to the conclusion that you are more successful. That's all, otherwise if you are not succeeding no one will put any pressure on you. You are succeeding, other people don't want to succeed, maybe they can't compete with you. So, it is a question of their using something else to put you down. This doesn't work. I mean, we have seen in many other fields, this has not worked; maybe for one year it will work, for six months it will work, later on they will have to give up this chase. The industry is, however, responding by diversifying markets to Europe and South-East Asia and placing emphasis on offshore software development. The Government is committed to providing the policy and infrastructural support that the industry requires. A number of policy initiatives have been taken over the past two years in order to give the proper incentives for the growth of the information technology sector in the country. Efforts are currently underway to provide the much-needed infrastructural requirements, in particular high-speed international data communication links, which have proved to be bottlenecks in the past. The true strength of the Indian information technology sector will really come into focus when the various sub-segments, such as, hardware, software and telecommunications combine to  provide total solutions for the needs of the users. This day is not far off, as is evinced by the displays exhibited here. We are hopeful that this thing will happen.","pms","rao","1993","199309","19930916","pmo","firstterm","inc11","nationalpol","speech","other","other","other","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","english","expandingthereachofinformationtechnology","scannedbook","pvr1993","2236","2236","notrans","collective","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","rao","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","pvr_spe","na","yes","others","m","inc","pvr_nt","pvr_inc11","inc_spe","inc_nt","inc_inc11","m_spe","m_nt","m_inc11","pms1993","pms_spe","pms_nt","pms_inc11","pvr","pvr","pvr","pvr","pvr","pvr","pvr","pvr","pvr","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","pms","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pvr","pms","others","pvr","pms","others","pvr","pms","others","pvr","pms","others","pvr_spe","pms_spe","o_spe","pvr_nt","pms_nt","o_nt","pvr_inc11","pms_inc11","o_inc11","mint","clean","lib","english","pms","pvr","nt","spe","f","inc_pvr","inc_spe","inc_inc11","inc_nt","lib_pvr","lib_spe","lib_inc11","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib1993","lib_inc_spe","pvr_spe_1993","pvr_nt_1993","inc_spe_1993","inc_nt_1993","other","o199309","pvr_spe_199309","pvr_spe","pvr_spe","pvr_spe","pvr_nt","pms_spe","pms_nt","pvr_spe","pvr_spe","pvr_spe","pvr_spe","pvr_s","pvr_s","pvr_s","pvr_s","Rs","Rs","Rs","Rs",NA,NA,NA,2624

Also, with the proposed entry of international players like POSCO and Mittal Steel into India, competition would be fiercer, especially in light of state of the art technology available with such new entrants.(c) The Steel Authority of India Ltd.(SAIL) has formulated a Corporate Plan 2012 which envisages enhancing capacity and building competitiveness for maintaining leadership in the Indian Steel Market. Competitiveness, defined in terms of cost, quality and growth will be achieved by optimum usage of existing assets and the induction of new assets/ technology. Competitiveness would also be achieved by proactive strategies for sourcing key raw materials. The plan envisages a growth in production to 22.5 MT of Hot Metal with an investment of about Rs.37,000 Crores. To bring down the cost of production, technological innovations like augmenting concast route, 100% Basic Oxygen Furnaces, introduction of auxiliary fuels usage, oxygen enrichment, increase in power generation through Joint Ventures etc.are planned to be introduced. Ten new finishing mills with state of art technology are planned to be installed. SAIL has made extensive plans to improve the quality of products across the value chain and make value added steel, which will help in improving marketability and financial performance. Substantial Investments are proposed in the areas of pre and post treatment of metal, on-line testing and quality control facilities, standardization / automation / process control & Information Technology. Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd.(RINL), another public sector undertaking is implementing an ambitious expansion programme to increase its liquid steel capacity from 3MT to 6.3 MT, to augment its production capacity.","minister","ls14","2006","200608","20060814","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2006","90319","166160","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shriramvilaspaswan","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2006","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2006","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2006","l14_nt_2006","inc_qna_2006","inc_nt_2006","other","n200608","l14_qna_200608","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","Steel","awhetherpublicsectorsteelplantsarefacingstiffcompetitionfromglobalsteelcompaniesbifsothedetailsthereofandcthestepsbeingtakentoenablethePublicSectorsteelcompaniestofacethecompetition","newdelhi",338

Several steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management to ensure sustainability of water resources are undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments through various schemes and programmes.

I had a letter from Chi. Maganlal. I can make nothing of your
meeting. Nor can I gather the purport of the minutes. I do not
understand why you cannot have your original place on your return.
Let me know what the upshot of it all was. I am not writing separately
to Chi. Maganlal. I am rather busy with accounts work. In case they
do not accept you as manager, they should, it may be suggested,
decide what work to assign to you in the press. All the same, you had
better remain quiet for the present. Let me know what happens. Given
patience, this phantom will disappear. I should like to feel sure that
you are unperturbed.

The accompanying list of subscriptions to the famine-relief
fund sent by Chi. Abhechand1 is to be published.2 The cheque has
been received here.

"i23650","t19330513237505","All should know that, even though I am supposed to be a free
man, the Harijan will continue to be edited just as if I was in prison. It
will still be solely devoted to the Harijan cause and will scrupulously
exclude all politics. It is a matter of regret to me that for three weeks I
shall not be able to write anything for the Harijan. But, if God spares
me, I hope to write for the Harijan with better qualifications. I hope,
further, that in the mean while the Harijan cause will make rapid
progress,  that  reformers  and  sanatanists  will  combine,  wherever
possible, to serve Harijans, that reformers will work the rest of the
programme without wounding the susceptibilities of the sanatanists
and  that  the  Harijans  themselves  will, by  vigorously  prosecuting
internal reforms to which I have drawn attention so often in these
columns, make it easier for sanatanists and reformers to recognize that
Harijans are truly ‘Harijans’ and that they are capable of responding
to love precisely in the same manner and to the same degree as others.

spiritual nourishment you need. I have no doubt that once you have
mastered the elements of this science you will get thoroughly
interested in it. Learning the elements of anything is always difficult
and irksome. It is so with the delightful art of music too. We all know
about mathematics. The same is the case of this grand and noble
science of the charkha. I call it grand because the more closely we
study it the more we discover in it. And we need as much skill to attain
proficiency in it as in any other major craft. I call this noble because it
touches millions of people. I know of no other science save
agriculture which has such universal applica-tion. Therefore I wish
your devotion to this task is strengthened.

I have understood your nature. You keep away from a thing so
long as your head and heart do not accept it fully and this is quite

I have your letter. I was somewhat worrid after I sent you back
but was relieved when I duly received your letter. I hope you had no
difficulty in finding out your train and obtaining a seat at
Mughalsarai. Did you have to pay more than Rs.10 for your fare?
Keep up your daily lessons in the Gita, English and Arithmetic. Write
something in your diary every day. Recite the shlokas in the presence
of someone who knows Sanskrit. Free yourself from all fear. Write to
me about father’s health. We are all fine. It is, of course, cold here.

"i42596","t19460930157238","Wherever I may be I am always surrounded by an atmosphere
of spinning and khadi. I informed you the day before yesterday that
another charkha class would be held here from today for seven days.
This time the teachers are better prepared and all the accessories for
teaching are also available. It was intended not to admit more than 30
persons at a time to the classes. But 38 came this morning and 34 this
afternoon. There were 21 men and 17 women in the morning and 14
men and 20 women in the afternoon.
This shows that there is enough faith and enthusiasm in a certain
section of the public. Is it then the fault of those who are responsible
for  teaching  or  the  present  age  that  spinning  has  not  become
universal? To put the blame on the times in which we live shows lack
of courage. Faith and diligence should rise above circumstances.  If
all work were to be carried out on this basis and in this spirit, God
would surely reward our labours.
Gandhiji requested those who had charkhas in their homes and were not using
them to make them over to him  either for  payment or  as  gifts.   More  wheels
were needed for the classes.  Those  whose  charkhas were not  in  working order
should take them to the Khadi Bhandar, Chandni Chowk, where they would be set
right.

"i5781","t19190618287506","DEAR MR. HIGNELL,

It is just likely that this letter will cause pain to His Excellency.
But I fear that it is my duty to inform H.E. that I contemplate
renewing civil disobedience in July next unless circumstances alter my
plans.

The awful experiences of the past two months and a half have
shown me that there is nothing save satyagraha of which civil
disobedience is an integral part, that can possibly save India from
Bolshevism and even a worse fate. In spite of the indications to a
superficial observer may appear to be contrary, satyagraha alone can
smooth the relations between Englishmen and Indians. I would like
His Excellency to believe with me that the exhibition of anti-English
feeling during the second week of April was not due to the advent of
satyagraha which is designed among other things to remove the
acerbity1 between the two members of the Empire but to pre-existing
causes and the further belief (and this is the more important) that the
madness was confined to certain small parts only of this great
continent because satyagraha had arrived and it was doing its silent
but most efficient and effective work during the critical period. I will
not deny that the military preparations had, too, something to do with
the preservation of peace in the other parts of India. But I venture to
suggest that satyagraha had a greater deal to do with it.

Anyway, such being my opinion of satyagraha and its efficacy, I
would be no longer justified in further suspending civil disobedience.
I wish I could persuade the Viceroy to see eye to eye with me in the
matter of the Rowlatt legislation. It is legislation which irrespective of
merits ought not to stand after the expression of public feeling against
it during the months of March and April. No doubt, there were many
causes operating in favour of the vast demonstrations witnessed on the
6th of April last. But the Rowlatt legislation was the causa causans. I
trust that His Excellency will see his way to withdraw the legislation.

My letter regarding the appointment of a committee of inquiry1
is already before H.E. as also my letter requesting the release of Babu
Kalinath Roy.2 Both these are matters of the greatest importance and
have an intimate connection with the Rowlatt legislation agitation. I
hope that both my requests will receive H.E.’s favourable
consideration.

It now remains for me to add that should a renewal of civil
disobedience become necessary, it will be confined only to myself, the
other satyagrahis will qualify themselves for civil disobedience by
assisting to preserve peace and by other services of an ennobling
character. My earnest desire is in the present circumstances of the
country to confine civil disobedience to the narrowest limits possible.
For the time being, all demonstrations including hartal will be
avoided.

Yours sincerely,

"i12280","t19270703355911","FRIENDS,

You have extended to me a very great privilege by asking me to
perform the opening ceremony at this function. It is a matter of great
grief to me that I shall be unable to make my opening speech myself.
You will agree with me that I ought not to take an undue advantage of
the liberty given to me by Dr. Subba Rao and those medical friends
who have been helping me. I want therefore to go as gently as
possible and not to put an undue strain upon my constitution. I
therefore reduced the few ideas that I have to present to you in
connection with this Exhibition to writing. Mr.Tathachary will read a
translation in the mother tongue of this province and then Mr.
Rajagopalachari will read to you the English original. I am sorry that
in this province you will not take the trouble of learning what is the
lingua franca of India or should be. I have been obliged always,
whenever I have come down to the South, to remark upon this
deficiency. You have now a Hindi Prachar Office also in Bangalore
and I do hope that at no distant time as I expect you will come up to
Tamil Nadu and Andhra Desha in Hindi as in khadi and so make up
your deficiency with reference to ignorance in Hindi. Had I seen in
front of me only my Mussalman brethren I know that I could have
spoken to them in Hindi. They are preserving the prestige of the
lingua franca but the Hindus are lagging far behind in the South. I
hope that you will run a close race with the Mussalman brethren in
Mysore and make up your deficiency in Hindi. With these few words I
shall call upon my friend to read the Kanarese translation.

After the reading of the Kanarese version of Mahatmaji’s address was over, Mr.

C. Rajagopalachari read in clear terms the following address of Gandhiji in English :
FRIENDS,

It is a matter of great pleasure to me to meet you in this lovely
city and find in our midst our veteran leader, Poojaniya Pandit Madan
Mohan Malaviyaji. Hindu tradition makes me always feel embarrassed
to take a leading part in any function at which he is present. For ever
since my return to our beloved country, I have looked up to him as to
an elder brother. But what I feel to be a call of duty enables me
somewhat to overcome the embarrassment.

On this my first permitted appearance on a public platform
since my illness, let me thank His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore
and its people for the great kindness and consideration shown to me
during my prolonged convalescence. Your lavish hospitality has made
illness itself attractive. But it has grieved me to observe, as I did in the
appeal issued by my friends for enlisting your support for khadi, that
they had endeavoured to exploit my illness by suggesting that if you
all supported khadi by subscribing to funds and adopting it for your
dress, my recovery would be quicker. I would ask you to dismiss this
consideration from your minds altogether. If khadi makes no appeal
to your reason and has no place in national economy, it must be
suppressed in spite of my weakness for it. In great national causes,
personal affections must be discounted as disturbing factors. And if I
have become so soft as to become enervated for want of support for
my whims and fancies, or may be, even follies, it is surely better for
the nation that I should become and remain so ill as to be unfit for
further mischief.

The Exhibition, which it will be my privilege presently to
declare open, is a right and proper kind of appeal. It is carefully
designed so as to give you an ocular demonstration of what khadi
meant and what it has already achieved. If its careful study conquers
your reason, but in spite of the conviction of your reason, you find
yourselves too weak to translate its dictates into action, then, indeed, let
your affection for me give you heart and courage to overcome your
weakness. For I stand before you as a self-chosen representative of the
dumb, semi-starved, because workless, millions of India whom the late
Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das appropriately called Daridranarayana.
Every pice you contribute to the support of khadi, every yard of
khadi you buy, means so much concrete sympathy shown by you for
these millions.

Let me then summarize the conclusions of workers in the service
of Daridranarayana which you may test for yourselves if you will
patiently study the literature that you will find on the Exhibition stalls
as also the results of khadi activity which you will find demonstrated
at those stalls. The Prize Essay on Hand-spinning by Messrs S. V.
Puntambekar and N. S. Varadachari traces for you the history of the
ruin of the only national and universal cottage industry of India as
also the possibilities of its revival. You will find it proved there that in
this country there are millions of peasants who have no occupation for
at least four months in the year, and that the only possible occupation
for them in their own cottages in nothing but hand-spinning. Many
good and well-intentioned people have suggested most ambitious and
attractive schemes of village reorganization. But I make bold to say
that not one of these schemes is at present in operation and that it is
not possible to enforce any of them, at least during the lifetime of this
generation; whereas, the spinning-wheel has been making its silent but
slow progress throughout the length and breadth of India. Its revival
dates from 1920 during which year, in spite of the forest of white caps
one saw in the principal streets of cities, in reality there was not to be
found khadi more than one lakh at the outside. But the carefully
prepared report of the All-India Spinners’ Association for the last
year will show you that during the year 1926 alone over Rs. 23 lakhs
worth of khadi was produced throughout India and that the sales
amounted to Rs. 28 lakhs. Capital investment by the Association
amounts to over Rs. 18 lakhs. Fifty thousand spinners worked during
the year under review for the production of this khadi.These spinners,
before they took to hand-spinning, had no other earnings or
occupation during the time that they gave to spinning. Their earnings
have ranged from one pice to two annas per day according to the time
they gave and the skill they put in it. The very fact that fifty thousand
women were eager to do this work for what may appear to us to be a
miserable wage should be sufficient workable demonstration that
hand-spinning is not an uneconomic, profitless or unpractical
proposition. In many instances women walk four miles to receive their
cotton. Round hand-spinning as the centre have been built up many
other occupations. Weavers, dhobis, dyers, printers and carders who
had either died out or were dying out have found in the revival of
hand-spinning a new hope. One new weaver and one new carder
comes into being against ten spinners and their wages are anything
between four annas and one and a half rupees per day. 1,500 villages
are being thus served by an army of more or less educated workers
whose salary ranges from Rs. 100 to Rs. 150 per month. Not less than
1,000 such young men and some young women find an honest
livelihood in this national service. The spinners and other workers
include Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, Sudras, the so-called
untouchables, Mussalmans, Christians, Parsis, Sikhs, in fact every caste
and creed. Besides the paid workers, there are several absolutely
unpaid volunteers too engaged in this work of reconstruction. In Satis
Chandra Das Gupta and Profulla Chandra Ghosh, Bengal has given to
this service two of Acharya Ray’s most brilliant pupils. Satis Chandra
Das Gupta had built up Acharya Ray’s chemical works. Profulla
Chandra Ghosh had been assistant assayer in the Government Mint.
Both left their lucrative posts to give themselves to khadi. Several
distinguished lawyers, even doctors, some of whom you know
personally, have given up their profession and taken to this work. And
it is slowly dawning upon the merchant class that khadi is a service
which does demand their mercantile ability. You will, perhaps, now
understand why I have called this hand-spinning movement the
greatest co-operative effort of modern times. And if six years’
progress, insignificant as it may appear compared to the mighty result
in view, is an indication of the future, God willing, at no distant time
we shall find our villages, which at the present moment seem to be
crumbling to ruins, becoming hives of honest and patient industry.

The Exhibition will enable you to understand all the processes
that cotton goes through before it reaches you as khadi. For you will
see ginning, carding, sliver-making, spinning and weaving
demonstrated before you. You will see also the very simple tools and
machinery which are being used for these processes. The charts will
tell you the output of these little machines, most of which can be esily
made in our villages.

I must not also omit to draw the attention of fashionable, artistic
and moneyed members of my audience to the will-filled stall where
you will see handsomely worked and embroidered fine khadi in the
preparation of which nearly 400 girls in Bombay are earning
anything between six annas and one and a half rupees per day. It is an
organization conducted by Rashtriya Stri Sabha of Bombay, which,
among other self-sacrificing ladies, includes the grand-daughters of
the Grand Old Man of India, Dadabhai Naoroji, and a sister belonging
to the great Petit family.

Madhusudan Das was a brilliant lawyer in Cuttack. The poverty
of Orissa woke him from his dreams and he saw that necessary as
work with plough and oxen in our fields was, we should soon be
reduced to the status of the bovine species unless we added to our
agriculture some industry which called forth the cunning of the hand,
and he has himself become a finished artisan.

But I must not any longer stand between you and the feast for
your eyes and intellect that has been prepared by the Exhibition
Committee. May it enable you to appreciate the priceless value of
khadi as a central fact in village organization and may it induce you
to establish between yourselves and the poor villagers a living bond by
sending those of you who have the leisure and the inclination to
villages to deliver the message of the spinning-wheel, and all of you at
least by adopting khadi for your dress and household use! In the work
of God, as I venture to suggest it is, the harvest is indeed rich but the
labourers are few. Every one of you can, if you will, add to the
number.

I have much pleasure in declaring the Exhibition open, and I
pray to God that He may bless the work, if it is commendable in His
sight and the workers be found worthy.

This over amidst impressive silence, Mahatmaji spoke the following few
words in conclusion :
FRIENDS,

I shall presently perform the opening ceremony by uncovering
a model charkha prepared at the Industrial Shop of the Department of
Industries in Mysore. Mr. Gangadharrao Deshpande, in his opening
speech inviting me to perform the ceremony, drew your attention to
the great help that is being rendered by the State and especially the
Department of Industries to this movement. They have prepared many
such charkhas. You will see in the Exhibition Court a variety of
charkhas, old spinning-wheels, which are still to be found in a more or
less dilapidated condition in Mysore and the evolution that a
spinning-wheel has gone through during these six years. The charkha
that I shall have the privilege of presently exposing to your view is by
no means the best in the scale of evolution. But we thought it was in
the fitness of things that an article made in Mysore should be first
exposed to view.

Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya will lead you to the Exhibition
Court. He has kindly consented to do this work for me in order to
spare me the strain of going through the Exhibition Court. He will
also continue the present proceedings this evening at 5-30 when he
will give you what his heart prompts him to give you on what he has
seen in the Exhibition Court, and what he has gathered during these
six years about khaddar and I do hope that you will all come and
listen to the message that he might have to deliver to you. You will not
attempt whilst he takes the leaders to the court to crowd round,
otherwise it will not be really possible to study what is to be studied in
the Exhibition. It is designed to be really a study for those who want
to understand what his khadi movement stands for and what it has
been able to do. It is not a mere ocular demonstration to be dismissed
out of our minds, immediately we have gone out of the Exhibition
Court. It is not a cinema. It is actually a nursery where a student, a
lover of humanity, a lover of his own country may come and see
things for himself. I invite sceptics to go there and pause not a few
moments, but to go there and pause a few hours and I promise that he
will find himself amply rewarded and possibly his scepticism also will
be dismissed. I invite the candid critic also to go there and I have no
doubt that he will find imperfections, he will find those charts not
drawn in artistic fashion, but he will find heart put into those charts.
They give you facts and figures which are compiled by students who
want only to serve truth and nothing but the truth. You will find there
always an understatement but not an overstatement. With these words I
have much pleasure to uncover the charkha and I hope that you will
all support this movement as it deserves.

Amidst great applause Mahatmaji then uncovered a charkha raised to the seat
of Gandhiji by Mr. Deshpande.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) conducts raids from time to time to detect and weed out corruption. During last three years the CBI had conducted five (5) Special Drives in this regard.(b): The CBI has informed that it had registered 174 cases against officials working in various Government Ministries/Departments employees of public sector undertakings and banks and private persons. During the afore-mentioned Special Drives the CBI either seized or detected cash amounting Rs. 109.70 lakhs and $ 2470 other investments worth Rs. 800.04 lakhs movable and immovable properties worth Rs. 1506.28 lakhs and Idols and antiques worth Rs.100 lakhs approximately.(c) & (d): The raids are conducted to unearth illegally acquired money and to check corrupt activities. Guilt of the officials found involved during raids have to be established in courts of law and following conviction of Regular Departmental Action dismissal or removal from the service can be ordered.(e): The respective disciplinary authorities take action as per rules and regulations against the officials after the raids. Such figures are not centrally maintained.(f) (g) & (h): The CBI has reported that reasons of acquittals are that due to long delays in concluding the trials complainants lose interest or are won over by the defence independent witnesses are not able to recall properly the events during the trial and also distortion of voice/wash samples due to storage over long period of time.","minister","ls13","2003","200304","20030422","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2003","1293","120256","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shriharinpathak","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2003","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2003","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2003","l13_nt_2003","bjp_qna_2003","bjp_nt_2003","other","n200304","l13_qna_200304","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","PersonnelpublicGrievancesandPensions","awhethertheGovernmenthavelaunchedanycompaignagainstcorruptionandconductedraidsinvariousdepartmentsduringlastthreeyearsbifsothedetailsthereofalongwiththeamountpropertyseizedduringeachofthelastthreeyearscwhethertheofficersfoundguiltyaftertheseraidsarestillinservicedifsothereasonsthereforethenumberofofficersagainstwhomactionhasbeenrecommendedbytheGovernmentduringthesaidperiodfwhethertheGovernmenthavenoticedanyloopholesinregisteringcorruptioncasesagainstapersonresultinginhisacquittalbythecourtgifsothereactionoftheGovernmenttheretoandhthereasonsforacquittalsbycourtincorruptioncasesduringthesaidperiod","newdelhi",257

"i413429","t20001211987105"," (SHRI M. KANNAPPAN) (a) (b) (c) & (d) : A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) (b) (c ) & (d) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION N0.302 FOR 11. 12.2000 REGARDING POWER GENERATION FROM SOLAR ENERGY.(a) (b) & (c) : Solar Energy is used in the country through two principal routes - the thermal route for water heating drying cooking etc and the photovoltaic route for converting the light to electricity which can be used for a variety of purposes such as lighting pumping and power generation. The Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) route uses solar cells which are encapsulated in panels (normally called modules) to generate electricity. To maximize the generation of power these are usually mounted on a tilted support structure facing the sun rather than horizontally or vertically. A number of SPV power plants have been installed in the country for meeting the lighting water pumping and other needs of villages and institutions. In addition some power plants have been installed for feeding power to the local electricity grid. The location wise capacities of the SPV power plants installed so far are given in Annexure - I. The Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources is also implementing schemes for deployment of SPV systems like solar lanterns solar home lighting systems street lighting systems and water pumping systems. Under the programmes of the Ministry about 3.15 lakhs solar lanterns 1.33 lakh home lighting systems about 0.41 lakh street lighting systems 3 458 water pumping systems and 218 power plants of about 2 528 kWp aggregate SPV capacity have been installed all over the country till 31st October 2000. The state-wise details of aggregate power generation capacity of these systems for the last three years are given in Annexure - II. Under the average Indian climatic conditions a kilowatt peak capacity of SPV modules is estimated to generate about 1500 units of electricity per year. In addition to the above SPV Modules have been deployed in the country for other applications like telecommunications railways defence etc.(d) : The Ministry is implementing several programmes to promote awareness and to support the use of various solar energy products in the country by providing fiscal and financial incentives like subsidy soft loan 100% accelerated depreciation concessional duty imports and excise duty exemption on certain devices and systems. The following steps have been taken up in recent years to promote the use of solar energy :  (i) Under the Solar Photovoltaic programme the Ministry provides subsidy for non-commercial users of SPV systems / power plants.(ii) A World Bank assisted soft loan scheme for photovoltaic market development is being implemented by the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) which is the financing arm of this Ministry.(iii) Soft loan schemes have been introduced for solar thermal systems through IREDA and some banks.(iv) R&D projects aimed at improving the efficiency reliability and economics of solar products are being supported.(v) A soft loan scheme for supporting photovoltaic manufacturing activities has been introduced.(vi) Special demonstration projects in new application areas and for developing new markets are being funded through grants.(vii) A model building bye-law for making solar assisted water heating systems mandatory in several categories of buildings has been drafted and circulated to all State Governments.(viii) A scheme to involve self employed workers in the promotion of solar cookers has been introduced.(ix) Other government departments are being encouraged to use solar energy systems wherever they are cost effective.

Having little time, I have delayed acknowledging your important

dedicated to Rama, Krishna and the like. There is no proselytizing
The addressee had moved to Betul.
Wherein the addressee had written: “Shri Dharmanand Kosambi told me that
you would like to look into the way the amount given by Birlaji for the Naigaum
Vihar is spent. I will do so; until the building is ready I shall see to the application of
this amount. Thereafter I do not know what I could do, being today identified with the

going to become Buddhists? Where is the need?... ”
taint about this movement. At the most it is to be a Hindu temple of an
advanced type in which a very learned man will be keeper or pujari.
That is how I have understood the whole scheme of Prof. Kosambi.
You may share this with the Professor, and if he endorses my position,
with Shri Natarajan, so that there may be a common understanding
about the temple.

GoM in its meeting held on 20th September, 2011 decided to do away with Go-No-Go concept. It was also decided that Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF) will revert to their original practice of examining the project by Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) on case by case base on merit, including the projects considered on the Go/No Go approach earlier.

As per the provisions of this CAR, airlines are required to develop fuel management procedures without compromising with the safety of aircraft and its occupants. Accordingly, to avoid additional fuel burn on account of unwanted extra weight, airlines have been asked for proper Weight Management. Airlines have been also asked that carriage of unwanted items such as old magazines & newspapers, excess duty free material, extra water, excessive crew baggage, empty baggage and cargo containers, etc.shall be avoided on board the aircraft during flight.(d) The said CAR was issued by DGCA on 5th August, 2015 to reduce the adverse impact of aviation on climate change. From Environmental Protection point of view, any additional fuel consumption will lead to unwanted increase of carbon emissions. The aviation community is committed to reduce the adverse impact of aviation on environment and this is one of the measures being adopted globally in this direction.","minister","ls16","2016","201612","20161201","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2016","219974","318965","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrijayantsinha","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2016","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2016","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2016","l16_nt_2016","bjp_qna_2016","bjp_nt_2016","other","n201612","l16_qna_201612","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","CivilAviation","awhethertheDirectorateGeneralofCivilAviationDGCAhasaskedallairlinestostopallowingexcessivedutyfreematerialandextracrewbaggageonboardifsothedetailsthereofbwhetherthisisbeingdonewithaviewtoensureefficientfuelmanagementduringflightifsothedetailsthereofcwhethertheDGCAhasalsoaskedtheairlinestoavoidunwantedextraweightinordertocurbadditionalfuelburdenifsothedetailsthereofanddwhetherthelatestdirectiveoftheaviationregulatorispartofadetailedcircularonclimatechangeinitiativesandlocalairqualitymonitoringincivilaviationsectorandifsothedetailsthereof","newdelhi",175

This includes procurement made from Indian private sector, Public Sector Undertakings, Ordnance Factories and foreign  sources. The accounting system does not separately capture data regarding defence purchases made from Indian private sector.(b) There has been a major thrust on indigenous manufacture of Defence equipment through collaborative efforts of Defence Research and Development Organization, Defence Public Sector Undertakings, Ordnance Factory Board and Indian private sector. Defence industry was opened up for Indian private sector participation in May, 2001, with FDI upto 26%, subject to licensing. With a view to achieve greater self-reliance in defence production, Government has announced a Defence Production Policy in January, 2011. Besides, the Government has included a new categorization Buy & Make (Indian) in the Defence Procurement Procedure in November, 2009 to encourage indigenous production in the country.(c) This matter is under inter-ministerial consultations.(d) The Department of Defence Production was restructured in January 2010 by assigning Land, Naval, Aerospace, Missiles and Electronic sectors to separate Joint Secretaries. Joint Secretary in-charge of Electronic sector also looks after defence industries participation and exports.","minister","ls15","2011","201112","20111219","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2011","208162","241582","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shriakantony","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2011","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2011","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2011","l15_nt_2011","inc_qna_2011","inc_nt_2011","other","n201112","l15_qna_201112","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","Defence","athetotalexpenditureondefencepurchasesbyIndiaoverthelastdecadeandthepercentageoftotaldefencepurchaseswhichhavecomefromtheIndianprivatesectorcompaniesbwhetherthepolicyofprocuringdefenceequipmentoverthepastthreedecadeshashadadefinitiveroadmaptowardsindigenizationandifsothedetailsthereofandifnotthereasonsforfollowinganadhocgaragesalepolicyondefencepurchasescwhethertheGovernmentisconsideringtoincreasethecurrentFDIlimitindefencemanufacturingsectorforpromotionofanindigenoustechnologybaseandtogenerategreaterdomesticemploymentandifsothedetailsthereofanddwhethertheGovernmentisconsideringaninstitutionalizedenhancementandenlargementintheroleofDepartmentofDefenceProductionandifsotheobjectivestobeachievedhroughsucharestructuringandifnotthereasonstherefor","newdelhi",208
"i44084","t19470605346124","GANDHIJI: We do not know the real meaning of freedom at all. I
am not unaware of the fact that while the day of freedom is nearing
licence also is increasing. Don’t we see frequent strikes and students
in  schools  and  colleges  insulting  their  teachers  and  paying  no
attention to their studies?
STUDENTS : Yes, that is true indeed. But what should we do when injustice is
G. You may, while observing perfect self-restraint, investigate
whether or not injustice has been done in fact. But you said that you
felt no freedom in the air and I have replied to that statement. Aren’t
you, for example, exercising your freedom when you attack school or
college buildings, force the authorities to give you a holiday or insult
your teachers? I want your reply to that. We shall have the fragrance
of real freedom only when we learn to observe perfect self-control.    I
ask these girls, if they have ever looked after their homes, whether
they are or are not free to throw out left-overs and dirty water on the
street.
As long as every child in the country does not realize that he
must not spit or throw rubbish anywhere it likes, for that makes his
own country unclean and harms the people’s health, till then this is
the kind of education that we most need. A country whose inhabitants
are narrow-minded and undisciplined can make no progress. Now
every man or woman is both subject and king, and it should, therefore,
be everybody’s aim to see that the country prospers. If that were so,
and which bodes ill for the future of the country would not have
occurred. If only I could convince the Hindus of this and if we could
learn to face death courageously, I have no doubt that our country
would rise to the grea-test height among the nations of the world.
Until we learn forgiveness, there is no hope of real progress for man.
All of you have come to Delhi. This is a historical city and has been
the capital of India for centuries. From the time of Shri Krishna down
to the coming of the Pathans, the Moguls, the Rajputs, the Marathas
and lastly the British and now our own Government, there has been a
succession of rulers, But don’t jump to the conclusion that, having got
power in Delhi, we have won the blessings of freedom. As long as
prosperity and education do not reach the hundreds of thousands of
villages in the country and make them happy, I will not believe that we
have swaraj. All of you are college students, receive higher education
in your colleges and follow the Western way in every detail of your
daily lives, from your mode of dressing to the food you eat. It is not
your fault that you do so; it is only the result of the fascination the
British Government exercises on us. But I will continue to believe
ourselves slaves as long as all these things do not disappear compl-
etely. For example, every Indian, whether educated or uneducated, has
learnt to have tea and biscuits the first thing in the morning. It is little
wonder to me that you have not felt the glow of freedom when I see
you hugging to yourselves the symbols of your cultural slavery.1 You
are wearing socks in this intolerable heat. (Laughter.) I can go on
citing such instances without end. My Point, in brief, is that till we
have eschewed, even in small matters, all Western things and ways
which harm the country, the society and our family life, we shall
remain  slaves. Some  features  of  their  civilization  are  admirable
indeed. But we hardly see anybody emulating those.
In the circumstances in which we are places today, it will be
inviting a calamity on us to resort to violence, for it will be extremely
1 This sentence is from Mahatma Gandhi—The Last Phase.
difficult for us to exercise any restraint in the use of violence. Don’t
think that it is only here that political parties are fighting with one
another and that there are no such disputes in Europe and America.
But the people in those countries are so well educated that they do not
lose their sense of proportion but always keep in mind the interest of
the country as a whole in everything they do.
They do not make a mountain out of a molehill as we do. They
never lose their sense of proportion. They have learnt to subordinate
everything to what they regard as national interest.1
Therefore, for India, non-violence was an absolute necessity. And the need
would be even greater, he emphasized, after independence when the external control,
which prevented various parts and parties from flying apart or at each other, would be
removed.
We have fallen so low that there is rivalry even between Banias
and Brahmins, that we never think who our real enemies are but only
consider to which community the other person belongs. Instead of
working in co-operation with our own countrymen and living happily
with them, we try to seek the co-operation of foreigners. We had the
most telling example of this the day before yesterday when with the
Viceroy’s help we partitioned the country. I know, and I suppose you
also do, since you hail from Bombay and  Poona,  that  even  our
religious observances and calendars differ. There is no uniformity
even in the incidence of the ekadashi or other days of fasting! On the
days on which the Vaishnavas fast, the Shaivas do not. And people
have made their God exclusively their own. There is but one God,
only He is known by different names. This is made plain in every
scripture beyond any shadow of doubt. The time has now come to
banish all ignorance about such matters. If we do not get rid of it, we
shall pay dearly for the mistake in future.
You are students. The future of the country depends on you.
When you asked me for time, I immediately agreed in spite of the
heavy pressure of work on me, for I look upon myself as a real friend
of students. Whenever I get an opportunity of meeting students, I look
upon it as my good fortune. And I am now seventy-eight and can,
therefore, say from my long experience that the more deeply you
think, while you are students, over the best way of making progress in
life and follow it, the more you will be able to advance your own
welfare and that of the society and the country. Student life is the best
time when you can learn to lead such a fruitful life.1
It is time we shed our inertia and girded up our loin, to grapple
with the challenge of independence.
What  the  situation  demanded, he  continued, was work,  solid  work;  not
recriminational or verbal pyrotechnics. Nobody had the right to waste  a  single
moment in idleness, self-seeking or disgruntled brooding. They had to be “like a
mother to whom no joy is greater than rearing and nourishing her child without a
thought of reward for her pains. . .2 Striving is everything. But if we strive with an
eye to fruit, it hinders our progress.” For instance, India had adopted the method of
truth and non-violence not as an end but only as a means  to  the  attainment  of
independence. Therefore, the moment that goal was reached, they fell away from it.
In the result we are where we are today. If we do not wake up in
time  and  replenish  our  depleted   reservoir  of   non-violence   by
engaging in constructive work as before, our last state will be worse
than the first.
If he had his way, Gandhiji went on to say, he would begin with a radical
reform of the military and the police. Under a non-violent order, they might keep a
small armed force for defence against external aggression while the people were being
organized for non-violent defence. But in the meantime and as a preparation of it land
armies with pickaxes and spades should take the place of armed police and engage in
growing more food, building roads, constructing drainage channels  and teaching
people discipline and strict observance of the rules of sanitation and cleanliness.
Their selfless service would then enable them to command spontaneous co-operation
of the people so that the anti-social elements would find themselves isolated and
powerless. Such a force could become a means for the realization of a non-violent
social order instead of being an instrument of coercion in the hands of the State.
As with the army so with the police. In England the police was regarded by the
people as their best friend and helper, a personification of the sense of duty,  but in
India its counterpart was dreaded by the common people as a bully and an oppressor.
I have not the slightest doubt in my mind that 99 per cent of the
responsibility for the present bloodshed and chaos rests on the police
and  the  military.  Instead  of  protectors,  they  have  become  the
disturbers of peace. The whole thing ought to be remodelled and the
colossal waste of public revenue on these two departments checked
immediately. The only way to cope with the rising tide of violence
successfully is to begin with police reform.
I have never been able to stop anybody who was eager to go
abroad for studies. I could not save even boys brought up in the
Ashram from falling a victim to such a desire. But hardly anybody
who goes abroad shows himself eager to be of greater service to the
country by going abroad. Of course there is much for us to learn in
foreign countries. But I can not help wondering why we are eager to
go abroad but make no effort to attract foreigners to our country. If
we wish to do so, them there is only one way, and that is that we
should overcome fascination foreign countries have for us and start
such activities in our own country. We shall be able to do that and
create something new only if we make experiments. For example, new
drugs are discovered and new surgical instruments are manufactured
in foreign ountries. Surely all these things did not happen without
experi-ments. But we have become so lethargic that as long as we get a
thin readymade we don’t wish to try and make it ourselves. I do not,
therefore, feel inclined to bless people who wish to go abroad.

Distinguished Guests,
Xin Chao

I would like to express my deepest appreciation to the Government of
Vietnam and its leadership for the warm welcome extended to me and to the
members of my delegation.

Friends,

My visit to Vietnam is to nurture a relationship between our two
societies and nations. The linkages between our two countries have deep
historical and civilizational roots, going back over two thousand years.
These cultural bonds reflect themselves in many ways. Most prominently,
in the connect between Buddhism and the monuments of the Hindu Cham
civilization. In recent decades, our shared and strong desire for the
progress and prosperity of our peoples has shaped our ties. In India, we
believe in sharing our knowledge, experiences and expertise with other
developing countries. There can be no better example of this than in the
success of our multifaceted bilateral cooperation with Vietnam over the
last four decades. The Cuu Long Delta Rice Research Institute, is a prime
example of the enormous impact of our cooperation. India helped set up
the institute in the Mekong Delta, sending agricultural experts and
training its faculty in India. Today, Vietnam is the world's third
largest rice exporter. We are happy to have partnered with Vietnam in its
emergence as a major rice producing and exporting country.

Friends,

As two partners, we must also take advantage of our synergies to jointly
face emerging regional challenges, and to exploit new opportunities. It
is a matter of great satisfaction that, we have now decided to upgrade
our relationship to a ""Comprehensive Strategic Partnership"". Next year,
we will celebrate the forty fifth (45th) anniversary of the establishment
of diplomatic relations and tenth (10th) anniversary of establishment of
the Strategic Partnership between our two countries. In a few months from
now we will jointly commemorate these milestones.

Friends,

I believe that a strong India–Vietnam partnership would lead to
prosperity, development, peace and stability for our people, and in the
wider region. Vietnam is a strong pillar of India's Act East Policy. Our
bilateral ties are based on strong mutual trust, and understanding, and
convergence of views on various regional and international issues.

Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

It gives me great pleasure to invite you to join me in a toast:

To the health and happiness of His Excellency Mr. Nguyen Xuan Phuc,
  Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and all of you
  present here;
To the wellbeing and prosperity of the people and leadership of

I feel worried because of the illnesses. I think you, Shakaribehn,
Parnerkar and others should leave Segaon for the present. It is not
right to risk your lives. But I hope to arrive there on the 11th. Mean-

you there. This is a new problem facing me.
I am not writing to Babudi today. I have no time at all.

"i59634","t20140128944608","It gives me great pleasure once again to be here amongst the young and
enthusiastic members of the National Cadet Corps. I compliment the NCC
cadets for their spectacular performance today and also for their
splendid march on Republic Day. Their discipline, their vigour and their
energy inspired all those who witnessed the parade. They embody
leadership, duty, courage and service. I am confident that with the
destiny of our nation in the hands of youth such as our NCC cadets, the
future of our country is bright.

The National Cadet Corps makes the nation justly proud. Ever since its
inception, the NCC has made immense contributions towards nation–building
and the promotion of social harmony in our country. It has brought
together people from diverse backgrounds, religions, cultures and
languages and inculcated in them the common values of humanism,
patriotism and selfless service. It thus truly symbolizes the philosophy
of unity in diversity, which forms the foundation of our nationhood.

On several occasions, NCC cadets have displayed exemplary courage and
bravery in support of disaster relief operations. The NCC played a
stellar role during the relief operations following the natural disasters
in Uttarakhand and Odisha last year. Our cadets also led the way in
voluntarily contributing Rs. 50 lakhs towards the Prime Minister's
relief fund. A grateful nation applauds them for this display of service
and sacrifice.

Social empowerment is another area where the NCC has been very active. We
deeply value the awareness drives undertaken by it on issues like AIDS,
female foeticide and environment protection. These initiatives are
praiseworthy and must continue.

The National Cadet Corps embodies fully the values important for our
nation's unity. I urge all our students and youth to join the NCC and
experience a life of camaraderie, adventure and discipline. There is no
better training ground for the responsibilities that await our youth in
years to come.

I wish to take this opportunity to compliment the NCC Boy Cadets for
scaling the world's highest peak in their first–ever Mount Everest
Expedition. It is a tribute to their teamwork, planning, stamina and
skill. The nation is proud of their achievements.

I also take this opportunity to convey my very best wishes to the young
cadets from many friendly countries who are here as part of the Youth
Exchange Programme. I am sure that they will forge life–long friendships
and carry back fond memories of their stay in our country. I also hope
that they will keep coming back in later years as friends of India.

My dear cadets, we are living in a rapidly changing and increasingly
interconnected world. It is only natural therefore that there is
tremendous yearning amongst our youth to transform our society for the
better. The youth today are not only aware and ready to articulate their
views, but are also willing and prepared to participate in shaping our
polity and society in a way that responds to their aspirations. This is
an extremely positive development. Aware and engaged youth are a force
that can truly transform our country and enable it to get rid of poverty,
disease, underdevelopment and ignorance. For that, we must follow what
Mahatma Gandhi said – we must become the change we want to see.

Dear friends, for me personally, this occasion has been an annual rite of
renewal for the past ten years. It renews my faith in our country, in the
values we stand for, in the youth I see before me getting ready to assume
tomorrow's responsibilities and therefore in the future of our country.
The energy, the vitality, the enthusiasm of our youth – all of which
are on display today – augur well for the future of our nation. I can
only say to you – go forth and do yourself, your parents and your
nation proud.

With these words, I once again compliment the NCC cadets for the
spectacular performance today and I wish them all success in their future
endeavours.

"i682549","t20180724909429","  (a) & (b): The statement showing details of commodity-wise Minimum Support Price (MSP) are given in the Annexure.(c) & (d): Procurement of cereals, pulses and oilseeds are undertaken at MSP by the designated Central, State and cooperative agencies in the states with the objective to ensure remunerative prices to the farmers for their produce. Producers have the option to sell their produce to Government agencies at MSP or in the open market as is advantageous to them. The Budget for 2018-19 has indicated that NITI Aayog in consultation with central and state Governments will put in place a fool proof mechanism so that farmers will get adequate price for their produce. NITI Aayog had held consultations on 9th March, 2018 with State Governments and Central Government Departments concerned to ensure farmers will get a price at least equivalent to the announced MSP. Three options were discussed: Market Assurance Scheme, which entails procurement by States and compensation of losses; Price Deficiency Payment   Contd2/-   -2-   Scheme, whereby, if the sale price is below the modal price farmers may be compensated the difference between MSP and actual/modal price subject to certain conditions and ceiling; Private Procurement and Stockist Scheme, whereby, procurement is made by private entrepreneurs at MSP and Government providing some policy and tax incentives and a commission to such private entities. The procurement operations may be decided on the basis of transparent criteria and bidding for the empanelment of private players by the State Government. It was also emphasized that all States should undertake market reform by modifying their APMC Acts in the line of the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017.","minister","ls16","2018","201807","20180724","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2018","264195","344862","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrigajendrasinghshekhawat","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2018","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2018","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2018","l16_nt_2018","bjp_qna_2018","bjp_nt_2018","other","n201807","l16_qna_201807","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","AgricultureandFarmersWelfare","atheMinimumSupportPriceMSPforkharifandrabicropssetbytheGovernmentduringthelastfouryearsbthedetailsofthecommoditywiseMSPandtheincreasemadethereinfortheyear201819ctheschemeformulatedbytheGovernmenttoensureprocurementofalltheagriculturalproduceofthefarmersafterdecidingtheMSPanddthedetailsoftheactionplanformulatedbytheGovernmenttopurchasethemaximumproduceofthefarmerssothatthefarmersofthecountrygetmaximumbenefit","newdelhi",279

"i466117","t20031209671579","  (a) to (d)A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. Statement referred in Reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question Number 102 due for Answer on 09. 12.2003. During each Five Year Plan the Ministry of Rural Development conducts a Below Poverty Line (BPL) Census with a view to identifying households living below the poverty line who could be assisted under various anti-poverty Programmes implemented by the Ministry. Accordingly the States/UTs were advised to identify the BPL households for assistance during the Tenth Plan and to complete the BPL Census 2002 by June 2003. However due to the ruling of the Hon`ble Supreme Court on 5th May 2003 in People`s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) Writ Petition No.196 of 2001 the State Governments have been advised not to finalise the BPL list until the next hearing of the case. The results of BPL Census (2002) are to be finalized after obtaining the directions of the Hon`ble Supreme Court in this regard. 2. The identification of the poor in BPL Census 2002 is to be done through door-to-door survey with hundred percent coverage in each village. A `Score Based Ranking` of each household indicating their quality of life based on both economic and social indicators has been adopted for the BPL Census 2002 in contrast to the `income` approach / the `expenditure` approach involving `exclusion criteria` adopted in the previous BPL Censuses. 3. No scoring point has been prescribed to qualify the households for BPL identity. The States/UTs are given the flexibility to decide the cut-off scores for identifying and sub-categorizing of the households into `Poor` and `Non-poor`. The cut-off scores may be uniform or could be varying from district to district block to block and village to village within a State keeping in view ground realities. The cut-off scores may be decided after tabulating the data for the entire State. 4. The estimate of poverty is done by the Planning Commission based on the Quinquennial Consumer Expenditure Surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO). According to the estimation of the Planning Commission for the year 1999-2000 27.09% of rural population was living below the poverty line. However the State Governments have been advised to finalize the list of BPL households in conformity with the estimates of the Planning Commission for the year 1993-94. 5. A total Central allocation of Rs. 18376.00 crores (RE) and Rs. 14070.00 crores (BE) for all the rural development programmes have been made for the years 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 respectively. This Ministry is implementing a number of programmes such as wage employment self-employment area development programmes sanitation and drinking water supply to uplift the rural people living below the poverty line.","minister","ls13","2003","200312","20031209","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2003","5307","128424","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shriannasahebmkpatil","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2003","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2003","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2003","l13_nt_2003","bjp_qna_2003","bjp_nt_2003","other","n200312","l13_qna_200312","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","RuralDevelopment","awhetheralltheStateshavecompletedtheBPLCensusbifsothedetailsandtheresultsthereofcifnotthetimebywhichtheBPLCensusislikelytobecompletedbytheremainingStatesdthescoringpointestablishedtoqualifyforBPLidentityewhetherstillalargenumberofruralpeoplearelivingbelowthepovertylineandtheUnionGovernmenthaveaskedtheStateGovernmentstofurnishlistofsuchpeoplefifsothedetailsoftheStateswhichhavesubmittedlistaboutpeoplelivingbelowthepovertylineandgthefundsallocatedtoStatesandstepstakentoupliftthepeoplelivingbelowpovertyline","newdelhi",472

I do want you to feel at home at the Ashram. I do not want you
to feel or think you are in the midst of strangers. Pick up a few words
in Hindustani daily and the linguistic barrier will vanish.

If the Ashram is your home, you must reproduce the necessary
home comfort. Pray demand them. Send me a line daily.

Remember that love is never afraid, it has no secrets. You will
therefore open your heart to all and you will, I doubt not, find a
response in every heart. Love will not be denied for it is ever patient
and ever suffering. And love is service, therefore, it ever rejoices in
service.

Do keep your health.

Yours sincerely,

"i17663","t19301129180655","Our civil disobedience is fulfilled when we seek imprisonment.
Disobedience would cease to be civil if  we defied  legitimate  jail
discipline. We may not therefore shout or create a row in the jails. We
may not refuse work when it is demanded of us according to rules. We
should rather be anxious to do as much work as we can and that too as
efficiently as we are capable of. It would be nice if even
prisoners’  volunteered  to  do  some  useful  work  not  necessarily
with a view to getting any remission. Prisoners undergoing simple
29, 1930, he observed: “He does not think himself competent enough to guide the
political  struggle today  because  he  is  removed  from  the  field  of  action.  To  a
satyagrahi, imprisonment is a civil death. But as a prisoner he can give authoritative
instructions for prospective satyagrahi prisoners. Daring my stay with him in the
Yeravda jail I discussed with him various aspects of the jail life and elicited from him
some useful instructions. He had no objections to my sharing them with workers in
the cause of swaraj. I give them below as they occur to me.
A satyagrahi should realize that his antagonism or disobedience ceases as
soon as he is convicted by the court. He is not out to paralyse jail discipline. In war, a
prisoner lays down his arms and capitulates when he is caught. The enemy can always
rely on the words of a true ‘soldier-prisoner’. A prisoner of war would not try to
escape, would not try to deceive when he is allowed an amount of liberty on the
strength of his word of honour. We, as satyagrahis, should try to be ideal prisoners in
jails. We must always be prepared to abide by the rules of jail discipline so long as
they do not go against the ordinary canons of humanity and self-respect. I have
sometimes  heard  some  young  satyagrahis  arguing  against  submitting  to  jail
discipline. They say: ‘We came to jail because we wanted to disobey the laws of
Government. How do you ask us to obey the rules inside the jail? We are pledged only
to non-violence but we will certainly defy the Government even in jails.’ “
imprisonment have helped a great deal in easing tense situations by
merely offering to do hard labour. Whatever work we turn out is so
much addition to the National Wealth.","histfigures","gandhi","1930","193011","19301129","preindependence","na","iim2","nationalpol","column","na","na","na","india","na","yeravdacentraljail","na","english","dutyofsatyagrahiprisoners","httpswwwgandhiashramsevagramorggandhiliteraturecollectedworksofmahatmgandhivolume1to98php","mkg1930","17668","23191","notrans","saksham","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","gandhi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","hist","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","mkg_col","na","yes","others","m","inc","mkg_nt","mkg_iim2","inc_col","inc_nt","inc_iim2","m_col","m_nt","m_iim2","his1930","his_col","his_nt","his_iim2","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","mkg","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","his","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","mkg","his","others","mkg","his","others","mkg","his","others","mkg","his","others","mkg_col","his_col","o_col","mkg_nt","his_nt","o_nt","mkg_iim2","his_iim2","o_iim2","mint","clean","plib","english","gandhi","mkg","nt","col","na","inc_mkg","inc_col","inc_iim2","inc_nt","plib_mkg","plib_col","plib_iim2","plib_nt","plib_inc","plib1930","plib_inc_col","mkg_col_1930","mkg_nt_1930","inc_col_1930","inc_nt_1930","other","n193011","mkg_col_193011","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_nt","his_col","his_nt","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_col","mkg_c","mkg_c","mkg_c","mkg_c","Gc","Gc","Gc","Gc",NA,NA,NA,403

The States are in a transition phase to implement these new components.(b) For implementation of new components of correction of system deficiencies up to distributaries of 150 cusec capacity and the renovation of Minor Irrigation Tanks, formation of legalized Water Users__ Associations is a pre- requisite, which is taking time as the State have to enact a new Participatory Irrigation Management Act or make amendments in the existing Irrigation Act of facilitate formation of Water Users__ Associations and signing of Memorandum of Understanding with them. Once, the transition phase is over, the progress under these activities will pick up.(c) Under the restructured Command Area Development & Water Management Programme, against the target of 0.23 million ha each for construction of field channels during 2004-05 and 2005-06, the achievement respectively is 0.375 million ha and 0.152 million ha (up to September, 2005).(d) The Programme implementation is being monitored and reviewed periodically to ensure achievement of the targets.","minister","ls14","2006","200602","20060220","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2006","138858","158316","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","profsaifuddinsoz","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2006","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2006","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2006","l14_nt_2006","inc_qna_2006","inc_nt_2006","other","n200602","l14_qna_200602","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","WaterResources","awhethertherestructuredCommandAreaDevelopmentCADandWaterManagementprogrammeshavenotachievedthedesiredresultsbifsothedetailsthereofctheareainwhichtheworkhasbeencompletedsofarunderthesaidprogrammesanddthestepstakenbytheGovernmenttoachievethetargetsfixedunderthesaidprogrammes","newdelhi",250

The entire range of activities of the Centres is monitored on a regular basis through an institutionalized system of monthly reporting by these Centres. The reports are carefully scrutinized at the ICCR. These Centres function as an integral part of Indian Missions abroad and hence their activities are also continuously monitored by the Head of Mission in the country concerned. Based on the ongoing process of monitoring and review, several steps have been taken for a continuous up-gradation in the quality, content and reach of the activities of the Cultural Centres. The activities of the Cultural Centres have resulted in a significant expansion of Indias cultural outreach overseas.","minister","ls15","2010","201004","20100421","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2010","204312","212494","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrismkrishna","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2010","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2010","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2010","l15_nt_2010","inc_qna_2010","inc_nt_2010","other","n201004","l15_qna_201004","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","ExternalAffairs","awhethertheGovernmenthasreviewedtheactivitiesofIndianCulturalCentreslocatedinothercountriesbifsothetimewhenthereviewwasundertakenlastandtheoutcomethereofandcthestepstakenbytheGovernmentinthelightoftheoutcomeofthereview","newdelhi",193

"i1352","t19060616660740","Lord Selborne made a significant speech while laying the
foundation-stone of the new Town Hall at Germiston. The speech
consists of advice on morality and politics. Addressed as it is to the
whites, it is perhaps of less direct interest to us from a political
standpoint. But from the moral point of view, Lord Selborne’s words
deserve to be pondered over. Accordingly, we summarise the speech
below:
The Municipalities exercise a necessary influence on the lives
of us whites, who are politically very active. They are the schools
which prepare men for the administration of the State. It is there that
the seeds of the freedom of a people are sown and nurtured. The
British prefer a harsh but self-governing political system to a mild
alien rule. At all times and everywhere, the Municipalities have been
the chief forum of public opinion. The Municipality serves as a
training-ground not only for its members but also for the electorate
and for others who discuss [public affairs]. The electors should never
forget how to offer legitimate criticism. This is a region in which
engaging storms blow. Storms are of two kinds: actual storms and
the metaphorical ones in politics. One who preserves one’s
equanimity during an actual storm can be said to have a cool and
collected temperament. In the same way, one who remains
unperturbed during a political storm is considered a man of firm
convictions. I should consider a person reliable who sticks to his own
way of life in fair weather and foul. A man should prove that he
isabsolutely firm in his principles regardless of whether or not people
interpret his words or actions aright.

Many thanks for your letter.
I  have  in  mind  your  suggestions.  I  am  considering  what is
possible. I can only take what people give.
Chhotubhai’s suggestion cannot be worked. We need no groups
as suggested. Everyone has to satisfy the lowest test. Nor is Diwakar’s
practicable. Some districts will give more some less. This is a voluntary
effort. I should be wholly satisfied, if only true men and women went,
no matter how few they are.

"i525204","t20080305511589","  (a): Yes, Sir.(b): The relevant extract from the recommendations of the National Knowledge Commission is annexed which gives details thereof.(c) to (e): the recommendation is under examination. Annexure referred to in parts (a) to (e) of Lok Sabha USQ No.1061 to be answered on 05. 03.2008 Extracts from the recommendations of National Knowledge Commission: on Higher Education __ Compilation of Recommendations on Education  Under Section 5: Rationalization of fees: On an average, fees constitute less than 10 per cent of total expenditure in our universities. And, in most universities, fees have remained unchanged for decades. In theory, universities have the freedom to decide on fees. In practice, however, universities have not exercised this freedom in part because of some genuine concerns about access but in larger part because of the rhetoric and populism in the political process. The problem has been compounded by the UGC method of providing grants-in-aid to bridge the difference between income and expenditure. Consequently, there is no incentive for universities or colleges to raise income through higher fees as that sum would be deducted from their UGC (or State government) grants. The low fees in public universities, without any means test, have meant unquantifiable benefits for unintended beneficiaries. But private players and foreign institutions have not been restrained in charging fees that the market can bear. The time has come to rethink, as we have no choice but to rationalize fees. It is for universities to decide the level of fees but, as a norm, fees should meet at least 20 per cent of the total expenditure in universities. In addition, fees need to be adjusted every two years through price indexation. Such small, continuous, adjustments would be absorbed and accepted far more easily than large, discrete changes after a period of time.

From 2013-14 onwards, interventions under NPCDCS for prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment of Cancer, which can be taken up upto District level, have been brought under the umbrella of National Health Mission. The treatment of Cancer patients in various Government Hospitals is either free or subsidized both for the Central and State Government Hospitals. In addition to Cancer diagnosis and treatment by the State Gover- nment Health Institutes, the Central government Insti- tutions such as All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Safdurjung Hospital, Dr ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, PGIMER Chandigarh, JIPMER Puducherry, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, etc.provide facilities for diagnosing and treatment of Cancer. The Government of India under Strengthening of Tertiary Care of Cancer scheme of NPCDCS will assist 20 State Cancer Institutes (SCIs) and 50 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCC) in different parts of the country. The maximum assistance inclusive of State share for SCI is Rs.120 crores and for TCCC is Rs.45 crores. The state- ments showing the releases of funds under the NPCDCS and TCCC scheme during the last three years and the current year, State/UT-wise are placed at Annexure-I and II. There is no central data available to ascertain the quantum of shortage of cancer specialists in the country. However, to increase the number of seats in courses in Medical Oncology, Surgical Oncology and broad specialty course in Radiotherapy, the ratio of number of Post- Graduate (PG) teachers to the number of students to be admitted has been now increased to 1:3 for a Professor subject to a maximum of 6 PG seats per unit per academic year. Cancer can be diagnosed and treated at various levels in the Government health care system. However, the number of Teletherapy machines in the country is less than the norms of WHO and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Oncology in its various aspects has focus in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna (PMSSY). The National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar and 2nd campus of Chittranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata also have a mandate for capacity building.

"i5799","t19190627381794","DEAR MR. HIGNELL,

I am just now going through what may be termed domestic fire.
I feel ashamed of myself. But circumstances sometimes happen which
you cannot control. I have just discovered that the copy I thought was
sent to you yesterday did not as a matter of fact go because of the
mistake made by my amanuensis. I now send that copy and the one
signed by Sir Narayan Chandavarkar and others. There is a third copy
in circulation which will be in your hands a day later.

Yours sincerely,

"i690698","t20190204323340","  (a) to (d): At present, there are 41 Central Universities under the purview of the Ministry of Human Resource Development. The total number of sanctioned teaching posts in 40 Central Universities is 17425 and out of these, 6141 teaching posts are lying vacant as on 1. 11.2018. In Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), out of 454 teaching posts, 190 posts are vacant as on 31. 7.2018. The University-wise details of sanctioned, filled up and vacant teaching posts are annexed. Occurring and filling up the vacancies is an ongoing and continuous process which goes on round the year. The onus to fill up the teaching and non-teaching posts lies with the Central Universities being autonomous bodies created under Acts of Parliament. Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and UGC continuously monitor the filling up of the vacancies in all the Central Universities. This issue is discussed regularly in meetings with Vice Chancellors chaired by Minister of Human Resource Development and also in the Conference of Vice-Chancellors held every year under the chairmanship of Honble President of India. UGC and MHRD have also taken various steps which include providing 5 Visitors nominees for Selection Committees of teachers for all the Central Universities, appointment of regular Vice Chancellors, enhancement of the age of superannuation for teachers in Central Educational Institutions to 65 years, etc. The UGC requested all Vice Chancellors of the Central Universities on 27th February, 2018 to prepare a time bound action plan indicating the timeline for advertisement of posts, scrutiny of applications, calling of interviews, selection/appointments of candidates etc. Most of Central Universities had started the recruitment process for filling up of vacancies of teachers. In the meantime, the Honble High Court of Allahabad passed an Order in April, 2017 directing UGC/MHRD to consider implementing the roster by taking Department as a Unit in place of University. The recruitment process was withheld in all the Central Universities as per the directives of UGC issued on 19. 7.2018 in view of the SLP filed by the Government against the order of High Court of Allahabad. Now, the Honble Supreme Court has dismissed the SLP Nos.14099/2018 and 14318/2018 on 22. 1.2019. With a view to protect the interests of SCs, STs and OBCs, it has been decided to file a review petition in the Supreme Court.","minister","ls16","2019","201902","20190204","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2019","245652","353011","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","drsatyapalsingh","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2019","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2019","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2019","l16_nt_2019","bjp_qna_2019","bjp_nt_2019","other","n201902","l16_qna_201902","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","HumanResourceDevelopment","athetotalnumberofvacantpostsforfacultyinCentralUniversitiesCUsacrossthecountryandthedesignationofthevacantfacultypositionsuniversitywisebthenumberoffacultypostsinCUswhichhavebeenlyingvacantformorethanayearuniversitywisecwhethertheGovernmenthastakenareviewofthereasonsforsuchlargenumberofvacanciesinfacultypositionsinCUsifsothedetailsthereofandifnotthereasonsthereforanddwhethertheGovernmentcanlistthenumberoffacultypresentasofdateineachoftheCentralUniversitiesandifsothedetailsthereofuniversitywise","newdelhi",398

The insecticides are registered for use in agriculture after rigorous scrutiny of scientific data to ensure their bio-efficacy and safety to human, animal and environmental health. The Ministry of Agriculture is popularizing the concept of Integrated Pest Management for control of pests, diseases and weeds on various crops which envisages use of non chemical methods including use of biopesticides and judicious use of chemical pesticides.

"i457039","t20030408485603"," (a) & (b): Yes Sir. The Government is aware of the earthquake activity in the vicinity of Koyana dam in Satara District. During the last three years 49 earthquakes of magnitude 3 and above on Richter scale have been recorded by the National Seismological Network of India Meteorological Department.(c) & (d) : Several initiatives have been taken by the Government of India to strengthen disaster management in the country which include capacity building search & rescue capabilities and web based disaster rescue network. The State Governments have been advised to draw up specific plans for capacity building ensure enforcement of building codes maintain inventory of resources and set up control rooms at the State and District levels. Satara district of Maharashtra is also a part of this initiative.(e): Recently the seismological observational network in the Indian Peninsular shield including Koyana-Warna have been upgraded with modern seismological equipment with communication links for quicker detection location and data dissemination. A telemetered seismic network has recently been commissioned in Koyana-Warna region for better detection and location of earthquakes in the vicinity of Koyana Dam. GPS studies to monitor small surface movements have also been initiated. The earthquake data recorded during the last three years is not conclusive of increase or decrease of earthquake activity in that region. The Koyana region falls in Zone-IV of the seismic zoning map of India published by the Bureau of Indian Standards. According to this classification the region is broadly associated with earthquakes of intensity VIII on Modified Meracalli Scale and is prone to damage due to earthquakes.","minister","ls13","2003","200304","20030408","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2003","73437","119345","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shribachisinghrawat","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2003","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2003","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2003","l13_nt_2003","bjp_qna_2003","bjp_nt_2003","other","n200304","l13_qna_200304","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","ScienceandTechnology","awhethertheUnionGovernmentareawareofthefrequentearthquakesinthevicinityofKoyanadaminSataraDistrictofMaharashtrabifsothenumberofearthquakesanditsmagnitudeduringthelastthreeyearscthestepstakenbytheGovernmenttostrengthenthedisastermanagementsystemoftheregiondthescientificinfrastructureinstalledorproposedtobeinstalledformeansofcommunicationinthisremotemountaneousregionandethescientificstudiesconductedandtheirconclusionsregardingthefrequencyofearthquakesandthepossiblechancesofthreattohumanlifeinthisregion","newdelhi",262
"i53383","t20060306598144","Hon'ble Members have raised several points in
the debate following my suo motu statement on our vote at the IAEA on
Iran's nuclear programme. I respect the views voiced by Hon'ble
Members on this important issue and I thank them for contributing to the
debate in this august House.



            Several members have made the point that our
foreign policy should be guided by national interests, and that our
positions on such issues should not be based on the position of other
countries. My friends, Shri Gurudas Dasgupta and Shri Subroto Bose made
these points, as did Shri Kharabela Swain. There can be no two opinions
that Government should not take pre–determined positions, or positions at
the behest of other nations. No one can dispute that it is Government's
duty to take a position on such matters after a dispassionate examination
of the facts, keeping in mind our national interests. I respectfully
submit that in the present case, the Government has done precisely this.
We have considered the facts and have exercised our independent judgement
before taking a position. This is also the very essence of the policy of
Non Alignment, which my friend Shri Rupchand Pal exhorted us to follow.



            Let me recapitulate the essential facts of the
matter:



Iran has the legal right to develop peaceful uses of nuclear energy, but
it also has certain obligations and responsibilities, based on the
Safeguards Agreement which it voluntarily undertook with the IAEA.

It was in recognition of the existence of several unanswered questions
that Iran agreed to start the process of assisting IAEA with
investigations into several past activities.

An important part of this process was the voluntary suspension by Iran of
all enrichment and reprocessing activity in November 2004.

However, since last August, Iran has renewed production of Uranium
Hexafluoride, and since then, of uranium enrichment.

Unresolved question regarding centrifuge imports and designs to make
uranium metallic hemispheres remain. The origin of such procurement is an
issue of direct concern for us.



Under these circumstances, our position was based on these facts, which
emerged from an objective investigation by the IAEA, and through
information disclosed by Iran itself.



There is also the question that several Hon. ble Members raised regarding
the IAEA Board of Governors' meeting today. Shri Chandrappan and Shri
Owaisi spoke of this. I should inform Members that it is as yet not clear
in what manner this issue will be taken up by the Board of Governors
today. The Resolution adopted by the IAEA Board of Governors last month
mentions certain steps that Iran and the IAEA will be taking. Discussions
are taking place in Vienna on this matter. The Government's approach
will be based on our consistent policy of promoting efforts for a
resolution of issues through dialogue and discussions. I would like to
assure Hon'ble Members that Government will take into account the
sentiments expressed in this House in this context.



Some points were also made regarding options that could have been
explored by the international community. There have also been discussions
between Iran and Russia in this regard. We remain hopeful that solutions
acceptable to all sides will be found. We do not favour confrontation,
rhetoric or coercive measures as these only exacerbate tensions in the
region and beyond. India has consistently stated that all sides must work
to find mutually acceptable compromise solutions, and that confrontation
should be avoided at all costs. For this to be possible, time must be
given for diplomacy to work. I think there is consensus in Parliament and
in our country that confrontation is not in the interests of India or of
our region. Whenever the matter is taken up, we will work with all
like–minded countries, including those from the NAM, for a mutually
acceptable resolution of the issue.



Several Hon'ble Members including Maj. Gen Khanduri expressed concerns
regarding our relations with Iran, and the effect of these developments
on this important relationship. As I said in my suo motu statement, our
Government is committed to widening, deepening and expanding our diverse
and mutually beneficial ties with Iran. Only recently, my colleague, the
Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri E. Ahammed, visited Tehran.
He had meetings with the President of Iran, H. E. Mr. Ahmadinejad, as well
as several Ministers of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Shri Ahammed emphasized our desire to remain engaged with Iran on all
issues of mutual interest. Our desire to further deepen the friendly and
productive ties between our two countries was fully reciprocated.



Government will continue to monitor the situation closely, and will deal
with the Iran issue with the seriousness that it merits.



In dealing with this issue, we will pay due attention to our relationship
with Iran, the need to maintain peace and stability in the Gulf region
and safeguarding our own security.



I reiterate that this House can rest assured that we will also take into
account the sentiments expressed in the House.

"i672950","t20180101047514"," (a): One of the objectives of the Mid-Day Meal (MDM) Scheme is to improve the nutritional status of children studying in elementary classes in schools covered under the Scheme, by providing hot cooked meal. The Government has adopted an elaborate monitoring mechanism at Central, State and District levels to ensure quality food is served to children under the Scheme. At national level, an Empowered Committee, headed by Minister of Human Resource Development and also a National level Steering-cum-Monitoring Committee (NSMC) as well as Programme Approval Board (PAB) monitor the scheme and suggest measures for its smooth and effective implementation. At the State level, a State level Steeringcum-Monitoring Committee headed by the State Chief Secretary and, at the District Level, a District Level Committee under the Chairpersonship of the seniormost Member of Parliament of Lok Sabha of the district monitors the implementation of the scheme in the concerned District. At local level Gram Panchayats/Gram Sabhas, members of Village Education Committees (VECs), Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) and the School Management Committees (SMCs) monitor the regularity and wholesomeness of the mid-day meal served to children, cleanliness in cooking and serving of the meal, timeliness in procurement of good quality ingredients, fuel, etc., implementation of variety in menu so as to make it attractive to children and ensuring social and gender equity on daily basis. The Government of India has also issued guidelines on quality, safety and hygiene on school level kitchens to all the States and UTs. These guidelines inter-alia provide for instruction to schools to procure Agmark quality and branded items for preparation of mid day meals, tasting of meals by 2-3 adult members including at least one teacher before serving to children and to put in place a system of testing of food samples by accredited laboratories. Further, the MDM Rules, 2015 provide for mandatory testing of food samples by Government recognized laboratories to ensure that the meals meet nutritional standards and quality. In addition, the Centre constitutes Joint Review Missions (JRMs) consisting of educational and nutritional experts, which review the scheme through field visits from time to time.

"i531951","t20081211175074","  (a) to (c) : Government has set up Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) to regulate the refining, processing, storage, transportation, distribution, marketing and sale of petroleum, petroleum products and natural gas excluding production of crude oil and natural gas so as to protect the interests of consumers and entities engaged in specified activities relating to petroleum, petroleum products and natural gas and to ensure uninterrupted and adequate supply of petroleum, petroleum products and natural gas in all parts of the country and to promote competitive markets and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has been set up w.e.f. 1.10.2007 under the PNGRB Act, 2006.(d) : Government is providing uniform subsidy on PDS kerosene and domestic LPG under the notified PDS kerosene and domestic LPG Subsidy Scheme, 2002. The details of subsidy given on kerosene and LPG for the period 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 are at Annex I & II. In order to check the black marketing of Public Distribution System (PDS) kerosene, the Central Government have made provisio ns in the Kerosene (Restriction on Use and Fixation of Ceiling Price) Order, 1993, issued under the Essential Commodities Act , 1955, according to which the dealers cannot sell PDS kerosene at a price higher than the price fixed by the Government or OMCs and that the PDS kerosene dealers should prominently display stock-cum-price board at the place of business including the place of store at a conspicuous place. Under the Control Orders issued by the Government to prevent diversion and black-marketing of kerosene under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, State Governments are empowered to take action against those indulging in black-marketing and other irregularities. With a view to checking diversion of subsidized kerosene and in order to monitor the movement of Tank Trucks transporting petroleum products, the Government have advised the public sector OMCs for installing Global Positioning System (GPS) based vehicle tracking system on all the tank trucks. The essential features of the system is that the vehicle carrying PDS SKO is fitted with a device and can be tracked on real time basis from the time it leaves the supply location and till it reaches the destination. To check adulteration in auto fuels, and also to check diversion of subsidized kerosene, Government have also advised OMCs to introduce marker in adulterants. Public sector OMCs have commenced introduction of marker in kerosene on all India basis with effect from 1. 10.2006. Under the new system, Marker is being put in kerosene in all depots. This system heralds the introduction of world-class technology to curb and eventually eliminate the menace of adulteration of transportation fuels along the supply chain. With the marker__s presence, adulteration even with very low levels of kerosene can be detected. MS/HSD Control Order, 2005, SKO Control Order, 1993 and MDG 2005 have been amended for making provision regarding introduction of marker system in Kerosene to check adulteration. Oil Marketing Companies in the Private sector have also been simultaneously asked to introduce marker in Kerosene as is being done by Public Sector OMCs. In order to stop black marketing of LPG cylinders, the Government has enacted __Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Regulation of Supply and Distribution) Order, 2000_ and formulated __Marketing Discipline Guidelines, 2001_ which provides for penal action against LPG distributors indulging in black marketing of LPG. Whenever OMCs receive complaints, these are investigated and if the complaint is established, suitable action is taken against the LPG distributor(s) in accordance with the provisions of the MDG. MDG provides for following action against the distributor:-  # Fine of Rs.20,000 plus the price of LPG diverted at commercial rates for 1st offence.# Fine of Rs.50,000 plus the price of LPG diverted at commercial rates for 2nd offence.# Termination of the distributorship for 3rd offence. In addition to the action taken by the OMCs, State Governments are empowered under the LPG (Regulation of Supply & Distribution) Order, 2000 promulgated under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 to take action against black marketing of domestic LPG. Similarly, the Weights and Measures Departments of the States / UTs initiate legal action against those LPG distributors found supplying under-weight LPG cylinders. The State Governments have been alerted from time to time to take steps against the black-marketing of domestic cylinders for unauthorized usage. Government have issued advertisements cautioning the public that use of domestic LPG for non-domestic purposes is illegal, dangerous and against national interest. Through these advertisements, cooperation of the general public has also been sought to report any irregularity / malpractice to the OMCs. The officials of OMCs carry out checks at distributors__ godowns, delivery points, as well as en-route to ensure that no pilferage takes place. The distributors of OMCs are under strict instructions to check the weight of cylinders at their godowns before delivery, and only cylinders with the specified weight are to be delivered to the customers. The distributors have also been instructed to ensure that the seals are verified & shown to the customers at the time of delivery. In case any under-weight cylinder is received by the customer, such cylinders are replaced with a fresh refill cylinder without any charges levied by the OMCs. In order to have a more convenient, easy and effective way to enable the customers to register their complaints for redressal, OMCs have w.e.f. 02.10.2008 started the service of Toll Free Numbers for complaint registration through call centers. This service is now available across the country.","minister","ls14","2008","200812","20081211","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2008","108548","194259","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shridinshapatel","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2008","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2008","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2008","l14_nt_2008","inc_qna_2008","inc_nt_2008","other","n200812","l14_qna_200812","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","PetroleumandNaturalGas","awhethertheGovernmentproposestosetupanindependentregulatorforfixingpricesofpetroleumproductsandtoprovidedirectoilsubsidyonLPGcylinderandkerosenetothepoorandthemiddleclasscategoriesofthecountrybifsothedetailsthereofcthetimebywhichthefinaldecisionislikelytobetakeninthisregardanddthedetailsofsubsidygivenonkeroseneLPGduringthelastthreeyearsyearwiseandStatewiseanddetailsofactiontakensofartocheckthemisuseofsubsidy","newdelhi",933

All cases are duly investigated by the Police and miscreants found involved in the incidents were arrested. There are adequate provisions of laws to deal with the cases of discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, language or religion. Advisories have been issued to all State Governments and Union Territories requesting them to have a stringent mechanism to deal with the incidents of attacks on citizens from North Eastern States. The State Governments and Union Territories are taking all necessary security measures to strictly follow the directions given in the advisories. In order to deal with the concerns of the people hailing from the North Eastern States living in different parts of the country, especially in the Metropolitan cities, a Committee was constituted in February 2014 under the chairmanship of Shri M. P. Bezbaruah, Member, North Eastern Council and other members to suggest suitable remedial measures which could be taken by the Government. Recommendations made by the Committee mainly legal measures, special police initiatives for safety and security of North Eastern people living in Delhi, NCR and other parts of the country, educating people about the North East and addressing their grievances of accommodations etc. The recommendations have been accepted and are at various stages of implementation.","minister","ls16","2015","201503","20150303","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2015","240921","289330","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shriharibhaiparathibhaichaudhary","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2015","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2015","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2015","l16_nt_2015","bjp_qna_2015","bjp_nt_2015","other","n201503","l16_qna_201503","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","HomeAffairs","awhetherinstancesofraciallymotivatedattackshavebeenreportedinthecountrybifsothedetailsofsuchcasesreportedduringthelastoneyearmonthwiseandthereasonsthereforcwhetherlawofthelandprohibitscriminalisationdiscriminationorviolenceonthebasisofraceethnicitylanguageorreligionandifsothedetailsthereofdwhethertheGovernmentproposestobringforwardalegislationtoeliminatecriminalizationordiscriminationonthebasisofraceethnicitylanguageorreligionandifsothedetailsthereofandetheotherstepstakenbeingtakenbytheGovernmenttodealwithraciallymotivatedincidents","newdelhi",303

"i45648","t19480128921911","Gandhiji said he had received a complaint from some friends in Bahawalpur
that they had asked for an appointment with him but failed to get it. Gandhiji knew
they were in distress and he would manage to find time for them if that would comfort
them. He, however, desired to assure them that everything possible was being done.
Dr. Sushila Nayyar and Mr. Leslie Cross went to Bahawalpur
and the Nawab has promised to help them in every way. In the Union
Capital, by the grace of God, there is again peace among the three
communities. This will certainly improve the situation all over India.
You know in South Africa our people are fighting for their
rights. Here in India there are no laws depriving the people of the
right of owning land or living wherever they please. It is true we have
reduced Harijans to some such condition but for the rest of society
that is not so. But I have seen with my own eyes that that is so in South
Africa. The Indians therefore are having to put up a struggle to
safeguard their rights and in defence of the honour of India. They
can resort to various means in their struggle but they claim to be
satyagrahis and their struggle has taken the form of satyagraha. They
keep on sending cables. They cannot even move from one province to
another without a permit. South Africa is like a continent. It is a very
large country. Indians wishing to go to the Transvaal from Natal can
do so only if they have a permit. They say it is as much their country
as anyone  else’s  and  ask  why  there  should  be  such  restrictions
imposed on their movements. Many have succeeded in moving to the
Transvaal and the Government this time have been decent. They have
not been arrested so far. They first went to Volksrust which is the first
city  after  crossing  the  border.  There  were policemen  present  in
strength but they only looked on and did not arrest them. There they
found a motor vehicle and proceeded in it further on. Then a meeting
was held there at which they were given a warm welcome. I thought I
should give you this information. Those Indians have performed an
act of great courage. Indians in South Africa are few in number but, if
they all become true satyagrahis,  their  victory  is certain  and  no
obstacle can stop them. But this has yet to be achieved. There are, as
here, many kinds of people. There are Hindus and there are Muslims.
They all work together. They know they cannot fight their battle
separately. They have reached Johannesburg but they cannot stop
there. They must go on and on till they are arrested. The Government
have a right to arrest them, for satyagraha implies the acceptance of
punishment for the violation of a law. They deserve congratulations. I
shall ask the Government of South Africa not to be too severe with
people who carry on their struggle with such decency. They should
understand their grievances and come to a settlement with them. Why
should it be that one with a white skin cannot have a dialogue with one
with a  black  skin?  Why should  Indians  have  to  fight  for  their
legitimate rights? How does it harm the whites if Indians too are
allowed to live there? Today we are also a free country as South
Africa is and are members of the same Commonwealth, which implies
that we should all live like brothers and equals. But if they consider
Indians their enemies and deprive them of their basic civic rights, then
they are not behaving as friends but as enemies. It is something
which is difficult to understand. Why should they look down on the
coloured people? Is it because they are industrious and thrifty? I shall
tell the Government of South Africa through this meeting that it
should mend its ways. I have myself lived in South Africa for twenty
years and I can therefore say that it is my country. I should have told
you all this yesterday but I could not do so.
Some Muslims from Mysore had sent me a wire a few days ago
saying that my fast had produced no effect there and Muslims were
still being killed there. I had also said a few words on the matter.1 Now
I have a telegram from the Home Minister of Mysore in which he has
refuted the charge made in the  wire and  has  explained  that  the
Government is trying to be just to the  Muslims.  I  must  tell  the
Muslims of Mysore what I have told all others, namely, that they
should not indulge in exaggeration. This hampers me and I am able
to do nothing. If anything they should try to water down such reports.
This is the only way Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs can live as brothers.
Our people are so simple that they send money by post. I
recollect  an  incident  from  my  childhood.  My  father  had  some
jewellery among which was a valuable pearl. He mailed it by post.
That was not cheating but it certainly was risky because, if anybody
had suspected it, they could have opened the envelope. In any case the
money was not saved because he wanted the acknowledgment by wire.
It seems there still are innocent people like my father. A friend sent
currency notes of over a thousand rupees in this way. He had the
envelope neither registered nor insured. He sent it by ordinary post.
When there is dishonesty and corruption everywhere it is a matter of
great credit to our Post office that envelopes with money are safely
delivered. They do not even want to see what an envelope might
contain. My advice to people who send money like this is not to take
such risk because in the postal department there are bound to be some
dishonest men and, if the money is misappropriated in the post, the
loss will be mine or that of the Harijans  for whom this money is
intended, and also of the donor. I congratulate the postal department
on displaying such honesty. Let the other departments follow their
example and take care of other people’s money and keep away from
graft and peculation.

"i588899","t20120814227884"," FOR CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (PROF. K. V. THOMAS)  (a) & (b): Information is being collected.(c) & (d): The Government has received suggestions that futures trading in food items should be banned on the ground that it contributes to price rise. These have been made by various trade associations such as Pulses and Grain Association, Sugar Merchants Association etc.but have not been substantiated with data. According to available information there is no clear evidence that rise in food prices in India has been due to forward trading. An Expert Committee chaired by Shri Abhijit Sen, Member of the Planning Commission that analyzed annual trend of growth rate in prices of sensitive commodities (food grains and sugar) in pre-futures and post futures period, concluded that although inflation clearly increased post-futures in some sensitive commodities that have higher weight in consumer price indices, it is not possible to make any general claim that inflation accelerated more in commodities with futures trading. Other factors, particularly demand supply mismatches, degree of dependence on imports and international prices in these commodities etc.also tend to affect commodity prices. There is no proposal to set up an expert committee to examine the need to ban futures trading in food items.(e): The futures trading on Commodity Exchange Platforms are closely monitored by the FMC. In order to improve transparency in the commodity futures market, the measures taken by FMC include inter-alia scrutiny of volume to open interest ratios, display of the information pertaining to the life cycle of the contracts on the website of the Exchange on a fortnightly basis, in order to make the market participants aware of the trading practices review of contracts, for better alignment with the physical markets etc. The FMC has also undertaken several measures such as imposition of deterrent penalties for misuse of client code modification facility and for executing trades without uploading unique client codes, compulsory audit of all members once in three years, quarterly settlement of client accounts, SMS and Email alerts to investors/clients by Exchanges, common Know Your Client (KYC) across Exchanges, Jago Grahak Jago campaign for investor education, installation of price ticker boards for price dissemination and disclosure of information regarding percentage of proprietary trade and client trade done on the trading platforms of the Exchanges.","minister","ls15","2012","201208","20120814","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2012","192035","251208","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","independentcharge","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2012","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2012","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2012","l15_nt_2012","inc_qna_2012","inc_nt_2012","other","n201208","l15_qna_201208","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","ConsumerAffairsFoodandPublicDistribution","awhethertherearereportsoffuturestradinginfooditemscontributingtopriceriseincommoditiesincludingwheatbifsothedetailsthereofcwhethertheGovernmenthasreceivedsuggestionsfromvariousquartersregardingbanonfuturestradinginfooditemsdifsothedetailsthereofalongwiththereactionoftheGovernmenttheretoincludingsettingupofanExpertCommitteetoexaminetheneedtobanfuturestradinginfooditemsandethestepstakenbytheForwardMarketsCommissionFMCtoregulateandbringabouttransparencyinthecommodityfuturesmarket","newdelhi",387
"i414735","t20001219682374"," (a) & (b): Indian Iron & Steel Company (IISCO) is a 100% subsidiary of Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and is a sick plant with poor performance and currently under the purview of BIFR since June 1994. IISCO is inherently uncompetitive due to its old assets and outdated technology leading to high cost structure due to higher variable cost of production and high manpower cost etc.which affects its profitability. Revival and long-term viability of IISCO would require comprehensive modernisation and capacity expansion at a considerable investment which SAIL is not in a position to undertake due to its poor financial health. Government has accorded approval for the formation of a joint venture for IISCO with SAIL having minority stake with the idea of facilitating the infusion of fresh investment by the Strategic alliance Partner for its revival/modernisation.(c) The main assets of IISCO are as under: 1. Integrated Steel Plant and township at Burnpur  2. Kulti Works 3. Iron Ore mines  (i) Gua Ore Mines Gua (ii) Manoharpur Ore Mines Chiria 4. Collieries   (i) Chasnalla (ii) Jitpur (iii) Ramnagore 5.

A cross sectional study undertaken in Delhi School showed that the prevalence rate of overweight and obese children is 29% this is an increase from previous studies which showed it as 16% (2002-04, adolescents). The reasons attributed to the rising prevalence of over-weight and obesity include reduced level of physical activity / increase in sedentary life as also increased consumption of calorie dense nutrient deficient food items.

As part of this strategy, village level health plans are envisaged to be prepared after undertaking resource mapping and need/gap assessment at village level. The Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) and Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) prepare these plans under the supervision of Village Health & Sanitation Committee. The Village level plans are envisaged to be collated into Integrated District Health Action Plans (IDHAP) at district level and the IDHAP are used for preparation of Annual Programme Implementation Plan (PIP) of respective state. Detailed guidelines in this regard have been issued by the Government and all the states have operationalised the decentralized planning process. The Government has undertaken a series of handholding and mentoring sessions to build capacity for decentralized planning. Under the NRHM, states have also positioned technical experts with skills in computers, data management and accounting etc to help the districts in finalising the decentralized plans.","minister","ls15","2009","200907","20090722","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2009","168560","200106","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrighulamnabiazad","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2009","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2009","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2009","l15_nt_2009","inc_qna_2009","inc_nt_2009","other","n200907","l15_qna_200907","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","HealthandFamilyWelfare","awhethertheGovernmenthasconductedvillageHealthInformationSurveyundertheaegisoftheNationalRuralHealthMissionNRHMtoprepareahealthplanbifsothedetailsthereofcwhethertheUnionGovernmenthaspreparedhealthplanaccordingtothatsurveydifsothedetailsthereofandethestepstakenbytheUnionGovernmentinthisregard","newdelhi",166

"i683806","t20180731997616","  (a) to (e): A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.183 DUE FOR REPLY ON 31ST JULY, 2018.(a) to (e): As per the information received from State Government of Mahrasthra, a group of farmers made a representation at the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Khamgaon, District Buldana, Maharashtra on 21. 03.2018 asking for the permission to commit mass euthanasia as a part of their ongoing agitation mainly demanding that compensation of their lands which had been acquired according to the National Highway Act, 1956 should be calculated according to the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation & Resettlement Act (RFCTLARR), 2013. It is informed that Agriculture is a State subject. Agrarian distress can be addressed by enabling the farmers to increase their income. The Government is targeting to double the income of the farmers by the year 2022. To achieve this, the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare has taken a number of measures. The Government has been reorienting the agriculture sector by focusing on an income-centeredness which goes beyond achieving merely the targeted production. The income approach focuses on achieving high productivity, reduced cost of cultivation and remunerative price on the produce, with a view to earn higher profits from farming. Various initiatives by way of schemes and policy reforms have been rolled out in consonance with this approach. Further, these initiatives are supported by a big jump in the much needed budgetary allocations for the agriculture sector. For the period 2009-2014, the budget for agriculture was Rs.1,21,082 crore. During 2014-2019, the allocation has been enhanced by 74.5 per cent to Rs.2,11,694 crore. Besides, Non-budgetary resources have been mobilized to supplement budgetary resources. Following are the corpus fund created during 2014-19: Contd.2/-  -2-  Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) to complete long pending 99 irrigation projects and create 7.6 million ha of irrigation by December 2019 - Rs.40,000 crore (2016-17 and 2017-18). The total investment is expected to be Rs.80,000 crore (approx)  Micro Irrigation Fund for water use efficiency - Rs.5,000 crore (2017-18)  Dairy Infrastructure Development Fund - Rs.10,881 crore (2017-18)  Fisheries and Aqua Culture Infrastructure Development Fund - Rs.7,522.48 crore (2018-19)  Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund  Rs.2,450 crore (2018-19)  Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund - Rs.2,000 crore (2018-19). The Department has been implementing various schemes for betterment of agriculture sector such as :  (i) Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme by which the farmers can know the major and minor nutrients available in their soils which will ensure judicious use of fertilizer application and thus save input cost of farmers.(ii) Neem Coated Urea (NCU) is being promoted to regulate use of urea, enhance availability of nitrogen to the crop and reduce cost of fertilizer application. NCU slows down the release of fertilizer and makes it available to the crop in an effective manner.(iii) Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) is being implemented with a view to promote organic farming in the country.(iv) Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was launched on 1st July, 2015 with the motto of Har Khet Ko Paani for providing end-to-end solutions in irrigation supply chain, comprising water sources, distribution network and farm level applications. Contd.3/-  -3- (v) Electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM ) which is an innovative market process to revolutionize agri-markets by ensuring better price discovery, bringing in transparency and competition to enable farmers to get improved remuneration for their produce moving towards One Nation One Market. The Department has achieved the target of integration of 585 mandis with e-NAM by March 2018. Additional 200 mandies to be integrated by 2018-19 under e-NAM.(vi) Existing 22,000 rural haats to be developed and upgraded into Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs). These GrAMs, electronically linked to e-NAM portal and exempted from regulations of Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs), will provide farmers facility to make direct sale to consumers and bulk purchasers.(vii) The Model Agricultural Produce & Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017 released in April, 2017 and the Model Agricultural Produce & Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2018 released in May, 2018, for adoption by State/UTs, to promote alternative competitive marketing channels for better pricing for farmers and to encourage private investment in developing efficient marketing infrastructure and value chain.(viii) Government has introduced Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) from Kharif 2016 to address the risks associated with agriculture. PMFBY addresses all the shortcomings in the earlier schemes and is available to the farmers at very low rates of premium. The farmers will get full insurance cover as there is no capping of sum insured and consequently the claim amount is not curtailed or reduced. This scheme provides insurance cover at all stages of the crop cycle including post-harvest risks in specified instances. Contd4/-  -4- (ix) The Government provides total interest subvention up to 5% (inclusive of 3% prompt repayment incentive) on short-term crop loans up to Rs. 3.00 lakh. Thus, loan is available to farmers at a reduced rate of 4% per annum on prompt repayment.(x) The Government is implementing several Centrally Sponsored Schemes viz. National Food Security Mission (NFSM); Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH); National Mission on Oilseeds & Oilpalm (NMOOP); National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA); National Mission on Agricultural Extension & Technology (NMAET) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) for benefit of farmers. Further, Minimum Support Price (MSP) is notified for both Kharif and Rabi crops based on the recommendations of the Commission on Agriculture Costs & Prices (CACP). The Commission collects & analyses data on cost of activation and recommends MSP. In the budget for 2018-19 the Government had announced that MSP for all unannounced Kharif crops will be 1.5 times the cost of production. Giving a major boost for the farmers income, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in its meeting held on 04. 07.2018 has approved the increase in the MSPs for all Kharif crops for 2018-19 season at a level of at least 150 percent of the cost of production. The MSP declared during 2012-13 to 2018-19 for various crops is at Annexure.","minister","ls16","2018","201807","20180731","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2018","280064","346119","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","SHRIRADHAMOHANSINGH","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2018","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2018","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2018","l16_nt_2018","bjp_qna_2018","bjp_nt_2018","other","n201807","l16_qna_201807","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","AgricultureandFarmersWelfare","awhetheragroupoffarmersinBuldhanadistrictinVidarbharegionofMaharashtrahasgivenanyrepresentationletterseekingpermissiontocommitsuicidebifsothedetailsthereofandthereactionoftheGovernmenttheretocthefactorsresponsibleforsuchaplightofthefarmersdwhethertheGovernmenthastakenanystepstodealwiththosefactorsandeifsothedetailsthereofandifnotthereasonstherefor","newdelhi",1071

Pollution control has assumed a
significant role, and commensurate with
industrial expansion, a strong regulatory
mechanism is required to ensure minimum
environment standards to achieve this
objective. A total number of 2,155 pre- and
post-1991 units of 17 categories of highly
polluting industries have been identified for this
purpose by  Central Pollution Control Board
The state-wise summary status of these 2,155
units is in Table 7.25.  Of these units, 1,877
units have provided  adequate facilities to
comply with the standards, 225 units have
closed down and the remaining 53 units do
not have adequate facilities to comply with the
standards. Legal actions have been initiated
against all the defaulting units.

In order to strengthen the environmental
management capacity at national, state and
local levels, the Ministry of Environment and
Forest had launched an Environmental
Management Capacity Building Technical
Assistance Project in 1997 with assistance
from the International Development Agency.
This project has an outlay of Rs. 140.62
crores.  The areas identified for capacity
building were environmental policy planning,
environmental administration, decentralisation
of environmental management, implemen-
tation of environmental laws, and monitoring
compliance in specific priority areas.

Do argue with me over Ganesan. I can fully convince you. I
have not given you advice, as you take it, to favour anyone. My only
consideration was the welfare of the Harijans. I believe that it is more
advantageous  to  get  work  from  Ganesan.  He  has  no  talent  for
collecting money. But he has the talent for work and for looking after
people. However, all this is useless if he is dishonest. The Committee
alone will collect the funds, but that pertains to the future. Who will
pay the past debt? If it was on account of Harijan, who has incurred
it? Will Sastri pay it? We shall discuss all this when we meet. There will
be a Hindi Sammelan in Indore from the 19th to 25th. I have to go

Andhra Pradesh State Civil Supply Corporation (APSCSC) Ltd.submits the claims for the expenditure incurred on account of transportation charges (on actual basis) to the FCI and the same is reimbursed by the Corporation as per the existing guidelines. However, APSCSC Ltd.has been requesting that FCI rates are lesser than the actual transportation charges being incurred by it. To fix the normative transportation charges, Government has referred the matter to Tariff Commission. At present, on receipt of the bills from APSCSC Ltd., FCI reimburses the transportation charges as per the slab rates fixed by it. Actual expenditure incurred including transportation charges for each year is allowed on finalization of incidentals on the basis of annual audited accounts/annual reports submitted by the State Government/State agencies.","minister","ls15","2009","200912","20091215","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2009","147660","207135","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","profkvthomas","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2009","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2009","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2009","l15_nt_2009","inc_qna_2009","inc_nt_2009","other","n200912","l15_qna_200912","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","ConsumerAffairsFoodandPublicDistribution","awhethertheGovernmentofAndhraPradeshhasrequestedtheUnionGovernmentforreleaseoffundswithregardtopaymentoftransportationchargesforcustommillriceandgunnybagsbifsothedetailsthereofandreactionoftheGovernmenttheretoandctheactiontakenbytheGovernmentthereon","newdelhi",178

"i43741","t19470410968880","1.   So far as pakistan is concerned and so far as the Congress is
concerned nothing will be yielded to force. But everything just will be
conceded readily if it appeals to reason.  Since  nothing  is to  be
forcibly taken, it should be open to any province or part thereof to
abstain  from  joining  Pakistan  and  remain  with  the  remaining
provinces. Thus, so far as the Congress is aware today, the Frontier
Province is with it (Congress) and the Eastern part of the Punjab where
the Hindus and the Sikhs combined have a decisive majority will
remain out of the pakistan zone. Similarly in the East, Assam is clearly
outside the zone of Pakistan and the Western part of Bengal including
Darjeeling,  Dinajpur,  Calcutta, Burdwan,  Midnapore,  Khulna,
Paraganas, etc., where the Hindus are in a decisive majority will remain
outside the Pakistan  zone.  And  since  the  Congress  is willing  to
concede to reason every- thing just, it is open to the muslim League to
appeal to the Hindus, by present just treatment, to reconsider their
expressed view and to divide Bengal.
2.  It is well to mention in this connection that if the suggested
agreement3 goes through, the Muslim League will participate fully in
the Constituent Assembly in a spirit of co-operation. It might also be
mentioned that it is the settled policy with the Congress that the system
of separate electorates has done the greatest harm to the national cause
and therefore the Congress will insist on joint electo- rates throughout
with reservation of seats wherever it is considered necessary.
3.  The present raid of Assam4  and the contemplated so-called
civil disobedience5 within should stop altogether.
members on the previous night.
4.  Muslim League intrigues, said to be going on,  with the
Frontier tribes for creating disturbances in the Frontier Province and
onward should also stop.
5.  Frankly  anti-Hindu  legislation  hurried  through  the  sind
Legislature in utter disregard of Hindu feeling and opposition should
be abandoned.
6.  The attempt that is being nakedly pursued in the Muslim
majority provinces to pack civil and police services with Muslims
irrespective of merit and to the deliberate exclusion of Hindus must be
given up forthwith.
7.  Speeches inciting to hatred, including murder, arson and
loot, should cease.
8.  Newspapers like the Dawn, Morning News, Star of India,
Azad  and  others,  whether  in  English  or  in  any  of  the  Indian
vernaculars, should change their policy of inculcating hatred against
the Hindus.
9.  Private armies under the guise of National Guards, secretly
or openly armed, should cease.
10.  Forcible conversion, rape, abduction, arson and loot culmi-
nating in murders of men, women and children by Muslims should
stop.
11. What the Congress expects the Muslim League to do will
readily be done in the fullest measure by the Congress.
12. What is stated here applies equally to the inhabitants of
Princes’ India, Portuguese India and French India.
13. The foregoing is the test of either’s sincerity and that being
granted publicly and in writing in the form of an agreement, the
Congress would have no objection whatsoever to the Muslim League
forming the whole of the Cabinet consisting of Muslims only or partly
Muslims and partly non-Muslims.
14. Subject to the foregoing the Congress pledges itself to give
full co-operation to the Muslim League Cabinet if it is formed and
never to use the Congress majority against the League with the sole
purpose of defeating the Muslims. On the contrary every measure will
be considered on its merits and receive full co-operation from the
Congress members whenever a particular measure is provably in the
interests of the whole of India.

"i641232","t20151218319242","a) to (c): The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) vide its circular dated November 3, 2006 issued guidelines on Managing Risks and Code of Conduct in Outsourcing of Financial Services by banks. Banks have been given the operational freedom to outsource activities related to financial services. It is entirely for the banks to take a view on the desirability of outsourcing a permissible activity related to financial services having regard to all relevant factors, including the commercial aspects of the decision. Necessary safeguards for addressing the risks inherent in such outsourcing are put in place, in the above mentioned guidelines. RBI has also issued instructions, vide its Master Circular on Loans and Advances  Statutory and other restriction (updated on July 01, 2015) regarding recovery of loans and engagement and training of recovery agents, methods to be followed by them, as well as for avoiding adoption of uncivilized, unlawful and questionable behaviour of recovery agents during the process of recovery, as banks are responsible for the acts of their agents. These are applicable to all Scheduled Commercial Banks, Regional Rural Banks and even Primary Cooperative Banks. In order to mitigate the problems faced by the customers, banks and their agents are also required to follow the Code of Banks Commitment to Customers issued by the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) and guidelines on Fair Practice Code for the Lenders. Further, non-observance of RBI guidelines on engagement of recovery agents by banks has been incorporated in the Banking Ombudsman Scheme as a ground of complaint with effect from February 03, 2009. RBI has also issued guidelines to banks on Fair Practices Code for Lenders. In terms of these guidelines the banks were advised to frame the Fair Practices Code duly approved by their Board of Directors. The Code inter alia requires that in the matter of recovery of loans, the lenders should not resort to undue harassment viz.persistently bothering the borrowers at odd hours, use of muscle power for recovery of loans, etc.","minister","ls16","2015","201512","20151218","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2015","252534","303545","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2015","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2015","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2015","l16_nt_2015","bjp_qna_2015","bjp_nt_2015","other","n201512","l16_qna_201512","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","Finance","awhethertheGovernmenthasentrustedprivatecompaniesforrealisationofloanamountduetonationalisedbanksifsothedetailsofsuchprivatecompaniesalongwiththereasonsthereforbwhethertheGovernmenthasnoticedthattheprivatecompaniesentrustedbythenationalisedbanksforrealisationofNonPerformingAssetsofthebankfromthecustomersadoptedillegalmeansforthesameandcifsotheactiontakenbytheGovernmenttoprotectthecustomersofnationalisedbanks","newdelhi",336

"i50353","t19880106829605","   It was two years ago when I had made my first visit to the Lakshadweep and, then, last year I had been to the other set of Islands the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. On both the visits I found that much of the work that we were doing on behalf of Government did not take into consideration the circumstances and the problems that existed on the Islands.  One of the reasons was that most of our senior administrators had never been to any of the Islands. They would sit in Delhi and make very fancy schemes, never having actually seen the problems on the Islands. So they neither understood nor did they realise the difficulties that you faced on the Islands. On the one side, we have your Member of Parliament, who would keep raising issues relating to your Islands in the Parliament, personally with me and, on the other, we had difficulty because there was no system which could even comprehend the type of problems that you faced. That is why after my visit to the Lakshadweep two years ago, we decided to make an Island Development Authority, an authority which would visit the Islands at least once a year-one year Lakshadweep, second year Andamans, third year back to Lakshadweep, so that senior administrators and ministers would be forced to come to the Islands. They would thus be able to meet you, talk to you, see and appreciate your problems at first hand. We have also seen in this very short period, that a lot has been done because now they see the problems differently. Now they try to understand the problems and for the first time, special studies are being made to know how we can have better solutions to your problems. We want that the solutions should be so designed that they are applicable to the Islands.  I do not want to go into the long list of achievements of the Island Development Authority. Your MP, your President of the Parishad, can give that to you later. But you will see that almost for the first time since Independence, the speed of development has increased very rapidly. And for the first time, development is being related to your problems. But this is only the beginning because, as I told you, we have ordered a number of studies and some of them have come up with results. So this is the time to go into those findings and work out solutions to the problems-how to remove unemployment, how to generate more work and employment, how to generate more wealth on the Islands. Equally important is how to protect your Islands. As environment and ecology are very delicate, we must not do anything in the developmental process which may damage these very beautiful Islands of yours.  One of the most important aspects from our point of view is to spread development among the weaker sections of the society, the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. We have seen over centuries that these have been the more neglected groups in our society and now, since Independence, we have tried to make up for this lapse by paying special attention to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Although a lot has been done, yet difficulties are there. You yourself have mentioned some. I read a long list of problems on the blackboard as I was entering. We have been attending to some of these problems even without your telling us because I was aware of them already. Your MP and other MPs have been telling me and for almost one year now we have been doing an exercise, along with all the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe MPs, to try and see how best we could get these problems solved; what sort of machinery could be set up. Some confusion was caused because of the setting up of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes Commission by the Janata Government, which did not really have any role to play because already the Commissioner was the constitutional authority. So on account of a dual authority there was a lot of confusion. Certain things, therefore, had to be gone into. We went into them and we have come up with some solutions. We have now given more authority to the Commissioner.  What was happening earlier was that the Commissioner was really only putting in complaints and there was nobody to look into those complaints. We have now upgraded the Commission and I have a Special Secretary only to look into the problems. So, if there is a problem, the Commissioner will complain to the Cabinet Secretariat. The Secretary in the Cabinet Secretariat will take direct action. If a complaint comes from the Commissioner that a Secretary in a department or in public sector is not looking into the basic problems of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, immediate action will be taken followed by punishment if necessary. We will not look for excuses and reasons why things have not been done.  Apart from that, we are also trying to see how we can give special training to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes because many a   NATIONAL AFFAIRS   5   time the opportunity is not available to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and yet you can keep saying there is reservation.  But you will never get the person if we do not impart proper training. And that is one reason that we are also examining the schooling system. Very soon a Navodaya Vidyalaya will be started in the Lakshadweep. There are Navodaya Vidyalayas coming up all over the country and here for the first time, bright young boys from Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the poorest sections will get an opportunity to have the best education that is available in India. Till now Government education, as I know it, had been bad and nobody had really cared whether the teachers really taught, what they taught, what was the curriculum, whether they attended schools and why they did not attend. What has happened is that most of the people who go through Government schools become unemployable. And this is what we are trying to change. For the first time, there will be opportunity for the brightest boys, no matter how poor they are or how deprived or how suppressed they are, to enable them to move ahead and meet the challenges that lie ahead, so that their disadvantage is removed from the root. No matter what we do to help Harijans and Tribals in any way, whether it is reservation or anything else, if the next generation does not get good education, everything that we may do for one generation goes totally waste.  We must see that the younger generation of our Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes does not suffer from the same disadvantages that their forefathers had suffered from. The basic cutting edge against poverty is education. Without good education, you are always at a disadvantage. So we are arranging right from the school level to advanced training programmes to help Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to rise to meet the challenges so that we do not have a situation where one can say, ""This reservation is of a technical type and it cannot be filled up."" We want to create more and more cadres in the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes so that these vacancies are filled up and nobody can turn round and say that a suitable person is not available.  In the schemes that existed before, there was one Commissioner and one department which looked after both the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. So what we did was, we created under one Commissioner two completely independent departments one to look after the problems of the Scheduled Tribes and another to look after the problems of the Scheduled Castes. Thus, while the Scheduled Castes will get no less attention than before, the Scheduled Tribes   6      will also get the desired attention.  Today, while coming to your conference, we passed by the old mosque where an attempt was made to throw out the Portuguese who had taken over the Islands. This being the 40th year of our Independence, it would only be appropriate if we build a memorial to Qazi Abu Baqer in this year.  I wish to thank you for the warm welcome that you have given me on Amini Islands, on Kavarathi and all other Islands that I visited. I wish you a most fruitful seminar and convention. It has given me great pleasure to inaugurate this convention.

"i49542","t19800726947960","
QUESTION : I think that one continuing interest since Independence is in 
the whole concept of democratic socialism. Now, you have said many 
times-and your father has also pointed it out that, in India, socialism 
has not meant a doctrinaire or scientific dogma, but it is an attempt to give 
economic content

PRIME MINISTER : I would not say it is unscientific. 

QuESTON : What would you say? 

PRIME MINISTER : It is not dogmatic or doctrinaire. 

QUESTION : I understood it as an attempt to give some economic content to 
democracy and also to carry out social transformation in a gradual, peaceful 
I think your father and yourself have used similar language. I 
wonder if you could discuss the ways in which you may have modified his 
thinking on either the goals or means. You have had the opportunity to 
observe his experiences, his successes, his theories, so that when you came 
to power, I wonder if you had thought either of using different methods to 
achieve the same goals or perhaps even in redefining the goals them-selves. 

PRIME MINISTER : No, the goals are exactly the same. 

QUESTION : How would you express the goals? 

PRIME MINISTER  The basic goal is to lessen the poverty of India and its 
economic backwardness and to make freedom real, which means working 
towards self-reliance in the economy, so that we are not pressurised by others 
or dependent on them in times of shortage or difficulty. I don't think that we have made any deviation from methods either. 
But what happens is not a question of where he succeeded or failed. We faced entirely different situations. He may well have taken the same kind of attitudes which I have taken, because while a person is living, he 
is changing and he is meeting the challenges which are thrown up by either 
events beyond control or even those which are controllable to some extent. 
The world today is very different from the world in which he lived. 
In India, it is different because after we became free, he was the undisputed 
leader, although there was a lot of opposition, there was a lot of carping and 
there was no shortage of difficulties. Nevertheless, he was the leader and 
people within the party did not think of going against him. Whereas, when 
I came in, there was a constant fight within the country and elements had 
gathered strength. This had happened in his lifetime towards the end of 
his life, where already people were not averse to using any means at all if 
they thought they would gain something politically, which was very 
unfortunate because it did hamper our progress. 

QUESTION : On this question of political means, Gandhiji stressed purity of 
means:As I understood your father, although he felt he had deviated from 
Gandhi's social goals, he kept faith with him on the principles of means and 
ends. You have also said that on many occasions. At the same time you 
have not hesitated to take action against opponents which your enemies 
call when they themselves had acted outside the framework of Constitution, 
whether it was the Marxists in West Bengal, or whether it was the JP 
Movement. 

PRIME MINISTER : The question is : Had Gandhiji seen a threat to India, how would he have reacted? 
It is not a personal thing. For instance, although he was so strongly wedded to non-violence, when Kashmir was 
3ttacked ip. 1947, he did support our action of giving military defence. 
am not equating myself by any means to Gandhiji, but one just does not 
know, in a given situation how Gandhiji would have acted. I don't think 
he would have tolerated half as much as I tolerated. He was very strict 
with his followers in regard to what they should do and what they should not do. 

QUESTION : In the cases that I mentioned, do you think there was a threat to India? 

PRIME MINISTER : Yes, there was a threat to India in the sense that if there 
is general chaos at a time of grave economic difficulty. Although he is now 
denying it, Mr. George Fernandes is on record in having said that he personally was responsible for so many derailments in one State alone, about 63 or so, in Karnataka and the Railway strike was not undertaken from the 
point of view of the workers' demands. It was called so that the Government would come to a stop.

QUESTION : Would you say that in Indian conditions, different political methods are necessary than in the case in 1950s or early 60s? 

PRIME MINISTER : Well, it is not just Indian conditions, but it is world 
conditions. You see what is happening in the United States. This did not 
happen in the 50s: the sort of crime, the violence, the attitude of young 
people, the going away from old values. Initially we thought that there was 
greater idealism, but I do not think that anybody thinks so now. India is 
not isolated. It is part of a world phenomenon. We are influenced by what 
happens outside and it is aggravated here or takes different shapes because 
of our own existing older problems or the new ones which development 
throws up. Many of our modern problems are those of development. 

QUESTION : May I pursue this line of your own experience being different
Accounting for any difference one may see, how did you respond particularly 
It started withduring the 70s, becauFe it is very difficult, turbulent decade? 
a great deal of optimism after the 1971 election. 'Garibi Hatao' was a 
very popular slogan and it crossed regional, caste, language lines. People 
were talking about popular awakening being finally able to use popular 
participation, carry out democratic social transformation, but, then the 
process of change was very slow. 

PRIME MINISTER : I don't think it was slow. 

QUESTION : Well, in one sphere, where there might have been basic structural transformations-the land reforms. 

PRlME MINISTER : But, before that nobody had been able to do that at all. 
I would not call it slow. Even the Marxist Government had not been able 
to do it in West Bengal. The very fact that we were able to make a break-through is a tremendous achievement. 

QUESTION : Well, were you satisfied? 

PRIME MINISTER : No, I am never satisfied. That is another thing. 
I am not satisfied and nobody who wants to do anything can be satisfied. 
I think once you are satisfied, in a way you are dead it comes to an end, whereas 
life is a constant moving forward. But it is possible that much more could 
have been done. But a beginning was made which nobody had been able 
to make before. Indian sociologists who were very critical of the slogan of 
'Garibi Hatao' and of our 20-Point Programme and various other programmes, were forced to admit that they had made a difference to people. 
And when I fought my Chikmagalur election, you know, I was in the 
Opposition, and we asked the people why they were voting for us, they said : 
""You only have to see our houses, you have to see what we are eating 
compared to what we ate before, you have to see how we are dressed 
compared to how we had before. So, in our minds there is just no question. 
We don't think there is a choice."" And I see not just in that one place, but 
It does not in all my travels that the health of the people has improved. 
mean there are no pockets of poverty. But poverty is not at the same level 
as it used to be, regardless of what statistics say. 

Of course, when there is drought, then suddenly it is a big push 
backward because there is so little that they can fall back upon. Even so, 
whereas in 1966 we had a drought and had to beg for grain now we had 
a very severe drought in 1979, but we did not have to get things. We do not 
have famine any more. During the drought we came in at the tail end the 
earlier governments had not dealt with the problem as they should have. 
Distribution or organising of relief camps and so on was inadequate. Even 
so, we were able toretrieve the situation. And now we are self-sufficient 
in food. The land question is never going to be solved, no matter what you do 
because there is not enough land. You can at the most say you can do 
better, you can take landaway from people who still have large holdings, 
and this we propose to do and according to existing law, but it is never going 
to be satisfactory because there is just not enough to go round. 

QUESTION : Given your answers to this question, your reaction to events 
after 1971, I am a bit diffident about asking the next question which is based 
on the assumption that you would have been disappointed from events of 

PRIME MINISTER : I would have been disappointed, but I do not think that 
disappointment could cover up the achievements. 

QUESTION : I think that is certainly a fair statement. The question I have 
in mind relates to the amendment of the Constitution made after 1971. You 
had said that you did not thinkGovernment was going to carry out any 
amendments and certainly you are not going to restrict Fundamental Rights. 
Then, after the fall, you became the first Prime Minister to give greater 
importance to Directive Principles than Fundamental Rights. This has become a very critical issue, particularly for Americans who never under-stand precisely why that should be done. In fact, if you were satisfied the 
way . things were going after the elections, why did you find it necessary to 
initiate the 24th Amendment which gave primacy to these clauses of Article 39? 

PRIME MINISTER : It is not a large number of people do not get their Fundamental Rights. Because if you don't follow up the Directive Principles, enough just to say that we are committed to these Fundamental Rights. 
How many people are actually enjoying them? You see, our society is so heavily weighted towards the status quo. 
In spite of all our efforts, my father's efforts, Mahatma Gandhi's efforts or anybody else's, it still is. Our 
Courts are very much in favour of those who have privileges. Even to make 
Fundamental Rights and the rights of the citizens real, to enable the citizens 
to avail themselves of the rights, the other part has to be implemented. 
Even today we cannot say, for instance, that the poorest people enjoy all the 
rights which are there in the Constitution. It is not because we are stopping 
them, but circumstances and society, social attitudes are such. 

QUESTION : What about the other controversial doctrine of committed judiciary and supersession of judges. 

PRIME MINISTER : We did not and do not have a committed judiciary. On 
the contrary, it was Janata Party Government who favoured a committed 
judiciary, committed the other way I personally never interfered in the appointment of any judge. Except 
those whom. I meet very formally, I never met the judges or tried to get in 
touch with them. But there was a view, and this view was held by the then 
Chief Justice as well as the Law Minister and this view is being held now 
also by many people, that there should be greater movement of judges 
because if they stay in one place, they get involved with something or 
somebody, whereas if they go to another State, then they go with a fresh 
mind and are not involved with local things. It was on this basis that our then Chief Justice wanted very large number of them moved. I said such a large transfer of people was going to create a lot of confusion, but he felt very strongly on this issue. 

And when we use the word 'committed'which we did use not with 
regard to the judiciary, but with regard to the bureaucracy - we did not 
mean committed to us we mean committed to the country, because in the 
old tradition they were looking outside for guidance, I do not mean to a 
person or a Government or a thing, but generally the influence of the West 
ideologically was very strong. What we were trying to say is that our 
circumstances are different, our needs are different, and we have to look at 
all these from the point of view of India's problems, not how the Americans 
would solve them. And this is what we meant. 

But the opposition always does tremendous propaganda. 

In my It father's time, we decided to have, what we call, co-operative farming. 
did not at all mean that land would be owned in common or anything like 
the Chinese communes or the Communist line of thinking. All we meant 
was that where people had very small holdings, if they could have something 
in common like a tractor and they worked together, then it would be easier 
for them to be more effective. They could plan their farming on co-operative 
basis. In times of difficulty, there would be greater cushioning. This 
was how it was worked out. But there was tremendous propaganda that 
co-operative farming is the same as collective farming, and the whole idea had to be given up. 

At no time did we mean that judges should be harassed. When the 
Janata Party came in they made all their appointments either on caste basis 
or on group basis. The Janata was not one party but several parties. That 
is how they broke up, because each was trying to promote his own party 
instead of the whole. At no time did we feel we wanted a committed 
judiciary except in the sense that we felt that the judges must have an idea 
of Indian conditions. The law is not something which is separate from the 
lives of the people. If you do not realize what the problems of the people are, then law would become irrelevant. 

I shall tell you something that happened in 1977, about two months 
after we lost the elections. This was reported to me by somebody who was 
in the JP movement and who was not at all with me at any time Agroup 
of people who had followed JP and who had followed Vinoba Bhave, i. e, 
With regard to the land movement and so on, went to different States and 
some of them came to see me before they went and one or two came afterwards and they told me a story about Orissa. 
In our land distribution, we had given land to tribals in Orissa. When the Janata Party came in, the 
landlords took back the land in Gujarat, Orissa and eastern UP. This 
particular person was rather aggressive and he asked some people for 
advice. They said, ""You have a legal case. You have been officially given 
this land, the magistrate has given it. You go to the court and nobody can 
take it from you. You have not grabbed it illegally."" So, he went to the 
court. But the judge decided almost without looking at the case because 
he said government had no business to have land reforms at all. That land 
obviously was granted by somebody nobody could have been born with 
that land. time or another. So he decided in favour of the landlord. This tribal went back 
and came back after a few days and he pushed his way into the court. 
People tried to restrain him, but he pushed his way and the Magistrate 
recognised him and said, ""What have you come for, because justice was 
done on such and such day?"" The man said, ""Justice was not done on that day, but it is done now"". He placed a parcel there and went away. 
It was the head of the landlord! Most people who have property, grabbed it at once.
It may be we did not go fast enough, but you have to balance how far 
we can go without creating a situation where you cannot do anything. 
Even now, because of our stress on the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled 
Tribes, there is a movement against land reforms. Some castes ask, ""Why 
should these people get so much land?"" You have to some extent do a 
It is not that you are afraid of going faster, but if you go balancing act. faster, you may well be pushed back. 

QUESTION: On this question of going faster, during the Emergency you did 
initiate more sweeping Constitutional changes. Did that reflect any new 
thinking on your part about the need, in Indian conditions, to change the 
fundamental assumptions of the Constitution? 

PRIME MiNJSTER : No, only to make them work for the people. 

QUESTION : Well, since that time those measures have been repealed. The 
Supreme Court has struck down the changes in Article 31 C. What is your 
position now? Do you think that the Constitution should be amended again? 

PRIME MINISTER : No. Now a change has taken. place because of the 
awakening among these people. Today, even those, who are fairly conservative, cannot express that conservatism, at least publicly. The Janata
Government went two steps ahead of us They voted for the removal of 
property from Fundamental Rights. The previous situation does not exist now. 

QUESTION : You have a more favourable situation now. You don't have the problem of leadership and party organization. 
It seems that it is the case that India has relied on Nehru for over fifteen years since Independence 
and now there are even suggestions that Rajiv should somehow fill the void 
caused by Sanjay and so on. Are you concerned by this kind of tendency towards personal or family rule? Or can you reflect on the reasons why this condition should have developed, even though your father tried so hard to 
establish deeply rooted democratic institutions? 

PRIME MINISTER : But how is it undemocratic? A person can only come 
forward if the people want that person And we have not thrust any person 
on anybody. 

QUESTION : I think in the sense that people do not vote for institutions, but for individuals. 

PRIME MINISTER : They always look to individuals, even in the United States. 

QUESTION : I am not sure about that because the democratic process can 
throw up someone like Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan whom nobody had 

PRIME MiNISTER : No, but on the other hand they are not voting for the 
Democratic Party or the Republican Party. They are voting either for Jimmy Carter or Mr. Reagan as people. 

QUESTION : Well, in the case of India, do you feel this is an adequate solution to the problem? 

PRIME MINISTER : It is the question of who they think can solve the problems. 
It does not mean that anybody in the Nehru family can do it. There have 
been others who wanted leadership, but they lave not been able to get it. 

QUESTION : But even if they think there is a person who can do it, there is 
another problem arising, which I think you and your father

PRIME MINISTER : It is largely the Press which has built up this thing that 
Sanjay wanted to be Prime Minister. Neither of my sons was remotely 
interested in politics, but because Sanjay was so criticized for his other things, 
he felt he had to protect himself Because I was Prime Minister I felt I 
could not protect him. This is how he came in, but even then he did not 
want to be in politics. When he went through this terrible ordeal three 
years ago, he started looking at things and got interested. But even so I 
do not think he would have liked a political career but it was the provocation 
of the Opposition that somehow thrust him step by step Beause, either 
you say, ""Well, I knuckle down and you can kill me"", or you can fight back. 
It is the fighting-back that brought him into politics. 

QUESTION : My other question is about the state of the Congress Party and 
now the Congress I. Every time it seems to have decayed as an institution. I do not know if you share this view. 

PRIME MINISTER : Well all parties have decayed, I would not say Congress 
alone. In fact the Congress has more cohesion than other except parties, of course the extremist parties. 

QUESTION : Well, it has decayed in the sense than in party units nobody is 
elected. They are nominated. There have been two splits that have weakened the organization. 

PRIME MINISTER : No, the splits have strengthened the Party. We would not have won the election if we had the old Congress. No doubt about it. 

QUESTION : Do you have any plan to put another elected party organization in place of the present one ? 

PRIME MiSTER : Every time we want to have election there is some crisis. 
When I say,""Have an election"", they say, ""You cannot have the Party 
election when there is Parliamentary election orStat eelection."" But soon we 
shall have the elections now that there are no national elections on the scene. 

QuEsnoN : Do you think the Congress I will be able to play the same role without the leadership of Sanjay? 

PruME MINISTER : Sanjay was not giving leadership to the Congress. 

QUESnN  No, to the Youth Congress. 

PRIME MINISTER : We have good people there, I think they will find

QUESTION : As to the final general question and keeping in mind the nature 
of the audience which is young and mainly Western, but also Indian, what 
qualities of leadership and achievements in domestic and international 
politics would you like to be known for among your young people who are 
interested in your career? 

PRIME MINISTER : I am not interested to be known at an 

QUESTION: Is there anything in particular that you consider specially valuable that you have learnt on the basis of your experience?  

PRIME MINISTER : I have learnt a great deal. I think one learns something 
everyday. But I think that largely my experience has only deepened what 
I felt before for India and the Indian people. I think they are pretty 
wonderful people they deserve much better than they have got. It is within 
their capability to work for it and to get it. That is why it is so unfortunate 
that politics here means fighting, instead of people working for a common 
goal. You talk about democracy. They are now planning major 
agitations everywhere. There was a rape case in Baghpat. Nobody is 
condoning rape. But it is not a new thing, it has been happening ahd has 
happened a great deal at the time ofJanata Party rule also. Many of them 
used to come to me and tell me. We did not think it was something that was to be shouted about. 
I did say that action should be taken. We approached the police, whoever we could. We did not think it was something that should be publicised that way. On the basis of this, they are now having a major agitation in U. P. at a time when there are floods, when so 
many other things have to be done. This is what really weakens democracy. 

QUESTiON : Are you able to say, what you think the major problems 
concerning India will be in the next five years? 

PRIME MINISTER : The immediate problems, of course, are the fuel problem, 
power shortage, and inflation, which we share with all the world. Only 
it is much worse for us for two reasons. Firstly, we are in between, I mean, 
parts of India are developed and large parts are undeveloped or developing. 
So, we have the disadvantages of both the situations. And we are so big 
that nobody can bail us out. We just have to stand on our own feet.

"i18724","t19310611978751","The Deshseva Mandal of Sind has published a little pamphlet on
the economic condition of the Bhils of Sind.  It consists of two articles

throughout the land will bring the message of free salt to the semi-

Your weight has gone up fairly well. Hence you should be asked
to stay on there. You did very well to have visited Gangabehn. You
gave me no news of Bachubhai's health.
What is Tansukh's1 salary?
It was hasty of you to have begun walking. Never be impatient
in anything. Rest your leg and have it completely cured. Why don't
you use home-made paper? It is quite easy to make and is cheap, too.
We ought to pay attention to things that are regarded as trivial. Now
that you are confined there,  should  you  not  introduce  as  many
country-made things as possible?
You may pay a visit to Nagpur. You may go wherever you want
to before reaching Segaon.
It seems I shall reach Wardha on the 17th at the earliest.
All here are doing well.
Tarabehn passed away on her way to Badri-Kedar. Mahadevi
nursed her exceedingly well. She had a severe attack of fever.

The process of Legislative reforms includes consultation with stakeholders including Central Trade Unions, Employers Association and State Governments in the form of tripartite consultation.(c) to (f): As per the survey carried out by the NSSO in 2011-12, the percentage distribution of workers in formal and informal sector in industry was about 7.6% and 92.4% respectively. However, corresponding estimates of manufacturing output are not available. Rationalization of labour laws and reducing the complexity of compliance will lead to better and effective enforcement of labour laws, thus enhancing job security, wage security and social security and improving the conditions of informal sector workers.","minister","ls16","2016","201612","20161212","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2016","274964","320604","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","IC","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2016","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2016","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2016","l16_nt_2016","bjp_qna_2016","bjp_nt_2016","other","n201612","l16_qna_201612","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","LabourandEmployment","awhethertheGovernmentisplanningtopushforlabourmarketreformsbifsothedetailsthereofandthereasonsthereforcwhethermajorpartofmanufacturingoutputinthecountrycomesfromenterprisesintheformalsectorwhileasimilarproportionofmanufacturingemploymentisgeneratedbyenterprisesintheinformalsectordifsothedetailsthereofandtheresponseoftheGovernmenttheretoewhetherthishascreatedalabouraristocracythatseekstoprotectitsprivilegesbutineffectkeepsthemajorityofindustrialworkerstrappedininformalenterprisesandfifsothedetailsthereofalongwiththestepstakenbeingtakeninthisregard","newdelhi",152
"i1974","t19070615764155","We have received for review two volumes of a series entitled The
Wisdom of the East being published in Britain. The first is called The
Way of the Buddha and the second, Persian Mystics, in which the
author has assigned the first place to Jalaluddin Rumi. An informative
account of Sufis is followed by a narrative of the life of Jalaluddin
and translations of some of his poems. In the author’s view, a Sufi is a
lover of God. Above everything else, the Sufis aspire after a pure heart
and love of God. Jalaluddin was once observed dancing with joy at a
funeral, and on being questioned what he meant thereby, the saint
replied, “When the human spirit, after years of imprisonment in the
cage and dungeon of the body, is at length set free and wings its flight
to the source whence it came, is it not an occasion for rejoicing?” We
can see that, in the olden days, even women freely participated in such
[Sufi way of] life. Rabia Bibi was a Sufi herself. When asked if she
hated the devil, she retorted that “her love of God left her no time to
hate anyone”. According to the Sufi point of view, no religion based
on morality can be considered to be false. In reply to a question
Jalaluddin said, “The ways of God are as many as the number of
souls of men.” Elsewhere he says, “God’s light is one but its rays are
various in hue. . . . We can worship God along any path, provided it
be with a true and sincere heart.”
Referring to the nature of true knowledge, Jalaluddin says that
“a blood-stain can be washed away with water, but the stain of
ignorance can be washed clean only with the water of God’s grace”.
And then again, “True knowledge is the knowledge of God.”
Whenasked where one could find God, the poet replied, “I saw the
Cross and also Christians, but I did not find God on the Cross. I went
to find Him in the temple, but in vain. I saw Him neither in Herat nor
in Kandahar. He could be found neither on the hill nor in the cave. At
last, I looked into my heart and found Him there, only there and
nowhere else.” This is an excellent book to read. We can endlessly go
on quoting passages such as those above. We should like to
recommend the book to everyone. It will be of profit to all, Hindus
and Muslims alike. It costs two shillings in Britain. The same firm has
also published Gulistan of Sheikh Saadi2, priced at 1s. Then there is a
book entitled The Essence of the Koran, costing ls. The Way of the
Buddha is priced at 2s and The Way of Zoroaster also at 2s. Other
books are to follow. If any of our readers wants one or more of these
books, he should send us the amount of the price quoted above, and
an extra 6d for every book. We shall procure the book for him. The
extra 6d is for postage.

"i43917","t19470506053213","The only effective means for improving the lot of our people
and preventing the eruption of violence around us is our Sudarshan
Chakra2  —the spinning wheel.
The history of cotton in our country is worth studying. Thanks
to the British rule—even a sample of the cloth woven by our weavers
150 years ago is not available today. As the saying goes the snake has
gone leaving only the track behind. If everyone in India spins daily,
not an inch of cloth need be imported. Our Government says that
Bengal is poor and so is Orissa. But somehow I am not able to swallow
this. Cotton is not grown anywhere on such a large scale as in our
country. The truth is we are not poor, we are lazy. If we discard
laziness and ply the charkha daily for at least half an hour knowing
do without food but not without sacrificial spinning even for a single
day. Swaraj and peace lie in the spinning-wheel. When I first took up
the spinning-wheel I did not have much knowledge about it. But my
nephew Maganlal Gandhi renounced everything for it and did a lot of
research in this field. One who possesses the spinning-wheel enjoys
complete freedom. Whereas those depending on mill-cloth become
slaves of mill-owners. Every person should determine his own needs
and should himself try to fulfil them and seek other’ help only when
it becomes unavoidable. Unless everyone develops this attitude and
becomes completely self-reliant, we can never be really free.

"i54256","t20081121452012","In the past four years your annual Summit has repeatedly focused
public attention on the challenges of development India is facing and the
opportunities before us in this new 21st century. Four years ago I have
said to you that one of the great experiments of the 20th century was the
struggle of the Indian people to seek their social and economic salvation
within the framework of a plural and liberal democracy. This in my view
will remain the great human experiment of the present 21st century as
well.

Nowherelse in the world you find a billion plus people trying to
transform their economy and the society in the framework of the
functioning democracy committed to full respect for fundamental human
freedoms and respect for the rule of law. I had said also then that the
“idea of unity in diversity”, and the great Indian philosophical
tradition that inspired it, remain our great inheritance that we would
like the entire world to embrace. The notion of cooperative pluralism and
respect for diversity that is the basis of our democracy must also be the
basis of global governance in the 21st century if it is to inspire
universal trust and confidence.

People everywhere seek well–being and sustainable livelihoods, but they
also seek fundamental freedoms. People do want jobs, people want
education, people want housing and health care. But people also want to
live in open societies and open economies. People throughout history has
sought freedom from tyranny in all its manifestations. They wish to be
governed by the rule of law. This has been the human endeavour in the
past and I suggest to this august audience that it will remain so in the
years to come.

India's success in transforming the lives of its people as a liberal
and plural democracy, a free society and a free economy, will I believe
provide hope for millions around the world. We may have paid a price in
terms of economic growth and efficiency, but we have gained as a free
people. Let us never belittle our achievements nor our ambitions in this
regard, and certainly not our struggle.

The world also has a stake in the success of the great Indian experiment.
The world will watch India's efforts to rid its people of chronic
poverty, ignorance and disease within the framework of a democratic
polity. The success of this Indian experiment will remain not just our
national ambition for the new century. It will also be the global
ambition.

At your Summit in 2006 I had reminded you of what Sir Winston Churchill
had once said, at the end of the Second World War. 'the empires of the
future will be the empires of the mind.' In saying so, he recognized
the great importance of knowledge in determining the destinies of
nations. The intellectual, cultural, social, economic and political
empowerment of individuals and societies is the basis on which the modern
world will be constructed. This defines our second ambition for the
coming century. India will not only be the land of a free people, but
will also be a land of a knowledge–empowered people.

My greatest ambition for the coming century or the present century is to
see a fully educated and empowered India. The light of knowledge must
touch every child, male or female and empower every one of our citizens.
I have this dream for our people because that was my dream as a young boy
in a distant village in the erstwhile State of Punjab. I stand before you
today because the light of knowledge has empowered me. I cannot think of
any other reason. Like millions of Indians I come from a family of modest
means. I lived in a dusty village with no doctor around, no school, no
electricity, no paved roads, no safe drinking water facility.

But it was the burning desire to learn, to be educated, that has brought
me here to these glittering halls from that distant village without hope.
It was scholarships and fair selection that educated me. It was a free
society and a land of opportunity that gave me opportunities for
self–expression and self–advancement. My dreams for myself have been
realized in my own lifetime because my country has made me. At your
Summit in 2007 I said to you that it is up to all of us to build the
foundations that can help us realize our vast latent potential for
development and social change.

Our challenges and our tasks present themselves to us everyday. It is up
to us to exert pressure on our system to deliver results. We must improve
the quality of our processes of governance, we must improve the quality
of our educational system. We must improve the public delivery system,
especially in health care, sanitation, drinking water, education and
public transport. We must build a more efficient and competitive society.
We must learn to respect the spirit of adventure and enterprise in our
entrepreneurs. We must provide an even better environment for individual
enterprise to flower and to flourish. These have been the focus of our
Government's policies these four and a half years.

The global economy is today, going through choppy waters. However, we can
and we will survive this crisis and emerge stronger if we have the
imagination, sense of unity and the will to work together as a united
nation. Competitive politics must not be allowed to divide our people on
the basis of religion, caste or region. At home and globally we seek an
inclusive growth process. Our century I sincerely believe will be shaped
by how we respond to the global economic crisis today. If nations look
only inwards and imagine that they can solve their problems on their own,
they will fail and fall. The world has become more integrated and
inter–dependent. In both good and bad, in prosperity and peril, in
opportunity and crisis we must recognise the new inter–dependencies of
nations and no nation is an island into itself.

That is why at the recent G–20 Summit last week I urged world leaders to
recognise these inter–dependencies and our stake in our collective
future. We need a global safety net so that the poor of the world do not
pay a price for the profligacy of the rich, and the delinquency of a few.
Global problems require global solutions. This is the most important
lesson of the past century for the present century. But global
institutions of governance must be made more inclusive and more
representative. The voice of the developing world must be heard in the
high councils of global decision–making.

The message of the economic and social crisis now gripping the world is
also that extremist ideologies, political or economic, have harmful
consequences. The idea of India, based on the rejection of extremes,
respect for diversity and pluralism and the acceptance of the Middle
Path, offers new pathways to progress for humanity in distress. When
nations have tilted to extremes they have either hurt themselves or
harmed the world at large. To regain balance they have always had to
return to the Middle Path of social and economic progress. I do believe
that such a pragmatic approach to policy can help us deal with the
challenges that our world faces today.

My call for moderation is not a rejection of boundless ambition. In some
areas of human conduct such ambition is a necessary part of progress.
Last week the Indian tricolour landed on the Moon. I salute with pride
our space scientists and engineers. A few weeks earlier the global
community agreed to recognise India's status as a nuclear power. I
salute with pride our nuclear scientists and engineers. I also salute
with pride the political leaders and policy makers who over the years
have invested in these ambitious programmes of atomic energy and space.

Both achievements, on the nuclear and space fronts, come more than half a
century after we as a nation set ourselves ambitious goals in the most
advanced fields of scientific endeavour. When Jawaharlal Nehru, Homi
Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai set for themselves the goals of tapping
nuclear energy and exploring space, ours was a much poorer country than
we are today. A less developed nation. Many mocked them for their
ambition. Our achievement today mocks the cynicism of the non–believers.
Such ambition must be commended and encouraged. It is the kind of
ambition that spurs human progress and widens human imagination.

I would like to see similar ambition in ridding our country of poverty,
ignorance and disease. I would like to see similar ambition in liberating
the minds of our people from the deadweight of prejudice and bigotry. I
would like to see similar ambition in our effort to educate and feed
every child. I would like to see similar ambition in providing safe
drinking water and electricity to every home across this vast land of
ours. I would like our women to be equal partners in sharing the fruits
of social and economic progress. I would like to see similar ambition in
our endeavour to secure a neighbourhood of peace and prosperity.

No goal is impossible, no hurdle, I believe, is insurmountable. But if we
set our sights low, no achievement is laudable. While celebrating our
achievement in space, let us reflect on its lessons for us on Earth. The
moon landing was the fulfilment of a vaulting ambition. It was the result
of years and years of hard work. Above all, it was the fruit of
cooperative enterprise. Hundreds of Indians, dedicated Indians – not
divided by their religion, not divided by their region, not divided by
their language or caste to which they belong, but united by their
commitment to hard work and passion for a scientific adventure that made
the realisation of the dream possible.

Who looks at our nuclear scientists or space engineers in terms of their
narrow social identities or their religious beliefs? Who asks them what
their caste is or to which region or State they belong to? Who asks what
their language is or region is? We only ask what their achievement is. It
is their work that defines them. Why cannot we look at each of our
citizens therefore in terms of their contribution to the promotion of
good neighbourliness, to promotion of communal harmony, to concern for
the well–being of marginalised sections of society, to peace and progress
around us? Is this an ambitious goal? Am I asking for too much when I ask
each one of you to stop identifying yourself in terms of how the past has
shaped you, but do so in terms of how you can and are shaping the future?
For the hundreds of women and men who put the Indian tricolour on the
Moon the past was no guide to the future they made possible in our
present.

Let no prejudice from the past shape, nor a hurdle in the present thwart
our ambitions for the future. We should be firm in our resolve to make
the future happen. That should be the message of your Summit this year.

"i667573","t20170725293181","  (a) & (b): Yes, Madam. The Government has been implementing Interest Subvention Scheme since 2006-07. Under the Scheme, interest subvention of 2% per annum is provided to Public Sector Banks, Private Sector Scheduled Commercial Banks (in respect of their rural and semi-urban branches), Cooperative Banks and Regional Rural Banks on their own funds used for short term crop loans upto Rs. 3.00 lakh per farmer provided the lending institutions make available short term credit at the ground  Contd2/- -2-  level at 7% per annum to farmers. Farmers are provided with 3% additional interest subvention for the short term crop loan of upto Rs. 3.00 lakh for a maximum period of one year for prompt repayment on or before the due date fixed by the financial institutions. Thus, farmers, who promptly repay their crop loans as per the repayment schedule fixed by the financial institutions, are extended loans at an effective interest rate of 4% per annum.(c): The Government announces annual agriculture credit flow targets towards production credit (short term crop loan) and investment credit (term loan). During the past three years i.e.2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17, the total agriculture credit flow targets have been Rs. 8.00 lakh crore, Rs. 8.50 lakh crore and Rs. 9.00 lakh crore respectively and actual achievement of ground level credit flow has surpassed the targets. For 2017-18, the annual agriculture credit target has been fixed at Rs. 10.00 lakh crore. The following measures have been taken by NABARD to provide financial support to strengthen finances of Cooperative Banks:-  (i) In order to improve the capital of the banks, NABARD has issued guidelines to achieve 9% Capital to Risk (Weighted) Assets Ratio (CRAR) stipulated by RBI and has also urged State Governments to provide capital support to cooperative banks in case the banks fall short in their capital mobilization.(ii) The Government has approved an assistance package for 23 unlicensed District Central Co-operatives Banks (DCCBs) to strengthen their financial position to enable them to secure RBI license and a total assistance of Rs 2560.29 crore was released to these banks with State Government share of Rs. 1998.22 crore and Central Government share of Rs. 562.07 crore. As a result, 20 DCCBs improved their CRAR and received license from RBI.(iii) NABARD is providing refinance to Cooperative Banks for financing short term {(Seasonal Agricultural Operations (SAO) } loans to farmers as per the funds allocated by Government of India from time to time.(iv) In view of banks facing liquidity constraints due to reasons like drought conditions and increased demand, withdrawal of deposits by Central Cooperative Banks (CCBs), etc. NABARD has provided additional short-term refinance for SAO to State Cooperative Banks over and above normal short term (SAO) limit during the year 2016-17.(v) On lines with RBI instructions, Cooperative Banks were advised by NABARD to act with empathy and consider restructuring and granting fresh loans without waiting for the receipt of the insurance claims.(vi) Refinance for Medium Term conversion for short-term loan on account of natural calamity is provided to Cooperative Banks making farmers eligible for fresh short term (SAO) finance. Contd3/-  -3-   (vii) Refinance support to Cooperative Banks is also provided for financing short term (Weavers)/short term-other purposes.(viii) Long Term/ Medium Term loan is also provided to enable Cooperative Banks to provide loans to farmers for undertaking all eligible agriculture and allied activities such as Dairy, Poultry, Minor Irrigation, Farm Mechanization, Land Development, Plantation & Horticulture, etc.(d) & (e): The National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD) and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raise claims with the Government under its Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS), wherein interest subvention of 2% per annum is provided to Public/Private Sector banks (PSBs), Cooperative Banks and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) on their own funds used for short-term crop loan up to Rs.3 lakh extended to farmers at a subvented interest rate of 7% per annum for a period of one year and a further 3% interest subvention to farmers provided a incentive on prompt repayment. As per the ISS provisions the banks should submit their audited claims to NABARD and RBI on a half yearly basis and these are forwarded to the Government for settlement. The Government clears the audited claims as and when these are received from NABARD/RBI. There is no proposal to provide 90% of the claim amount in advance.","minister","ls16","2017","201707","20170725","ndaupa","na","nda2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2017","261220","329886","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shriparshottamrupala","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l16_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l16_nt","l16_nda2","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda2","min2017","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda2","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16","min","others","l16_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l16_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l16_nda2","min_nda2","o_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l16","nt","qna","na","bjp_l16","bjp_qna","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_l16","lib_qna","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2017","lib_bjp_qna","l16_qna_2017","l16_nt_2017","bjp_qna_2017","bjp_nt_2017","other","n201707","l16_qna_201707","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_qna","l16_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","l16","Z","Z","Z","Z","AgricultureandFarmersWelfare","awhethertheGovernmentisoperatingaschemetodisburseshorttermcroploanattherateof7and3interestsubventionisalsobeingprovidedthereundertothefarmerswhorepaycroploanintimeandifsothedetailsthereofalongwiththelimitoffinanceofcroploangiventothefarmersbwhetherthefinancialinstitutesareentitledto2interestsubventionfortheirownfundsforshorttermcropfinanceandifsothedetailsthereofcwhetherhugefundsremaininvestedintheagriculturalcreditbywayofprincipalofinterestandifsothedetailsthereofandthemannerinwhichtheGovernmentisgoingtohelptheDistrictCooperativeBanksandPrimaryAgricultureCooperativeSocietiessothattheirfinancesarestrengtheneddwhethertheGovernmentisawarethattheclaimsoffarmersarenotpaidintimetherebydeprivingtheinstitutestoutilisetheirfundsforfurtheruseandewhethertheGovernmentiscontemplatingtosanctiontheclaimofinterestsubventionattheearliestorprovide90oftheclaimamountinadvanceinordertoreducethefinancialburdenofinterestandifsothedetailsthereof","newdelhi",750

"i460049","t20030507985492"," (a) & (b): Yes Sir. There is digital divide between Urban and Rural areas in regard to tele-density. The average tele-density in Rural and Urban areas are 1.51 and 14.71 respectively as on 31. 03.03. The tele-density depends on demand which is further dependent upon:-  (i) Per capita income.(ii) Developmental activities.(iii) Business and commercial opportunities.(iv) Literacy rate. Further the tele-density in urban areas is generally higher due to concentrated nature of demand and higher levels of business and commercial activities in urban area.(c) A number of policy measures have been taken during the past few years to expand the telecom services in the rural areas. The New Telecom Policy- 99 stipulates several specific objectives and time bound targets for tele-density and rural telephony. These are inter-alia increasing the rural tele-density from current level to 4% by the year 2010 and to achieve telecom coverage of all the villages in the country and also to provide reliable media to all the telephone exchanges.(d) Telecom Regularity Authority of India (TRAI) fixes tariff for the rural and urban telephony and the operators are free to decide tariff as per their business models.(e)&(f): Does not arise in view of (d) above.","minister","ls13","2003","200305","20030507","ndaupa","na","nda1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2003","31171","122356","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrimatisumitramahajan","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l13_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","bjp","l13_nt","l13_nda1","bjp_qna","bjp_nt","bjp_nda1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_nda1","min2003","min_qna","min_nt","min_nda1","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13","min","others","l13_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l13_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l13_nda1","min_nda1","o_nda1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l13","nt","qna","na","bjp_l13","bjp_qna","bjp_nda1","bjp_nt","lib_l13","lib_qna","lib_nda1","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2003","lib_bjp_qna","l13_qna_2003","l13_nt_2003","bjp_qna_2003","bjp_nt_2003","other","n200305","l13_qna_200305","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_qna","l13_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","l13","W","W","W","W","CommunicationsandInformationTechnology","awhetherdigitaldividebetweenurbanandruralareasiswideningbifsothefactsthereofandthereasonsthereforcthestepstheGovernmentproposetotaketoreducethedisparitybetweenurbanandruralareasintermsofteledensitydwhethertheGovernmentalsoproposetogivesubsidyintermsoftelephonerentandtelcallsforruralpeopleinfixedtelephonyeifsothedetailsthereofandfifnotthereasonstherefor","newdelhi",214

"i515510","t20070514635022","  (a) & (b) Yes Sir. The Sardar Sarovar Dam was originally scheduled for completion by January, 1998 according to the Revised Implementation Schedule, December, 1989 of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited. Due to the pendency of Writ Petition (Civil) No.319/1994 in the Hon__ble Supreme Court filed by the Namada Bachao Andolan, the work on main dam remained suspended since 1995. The writ petition was disposed off by the Hon__ble Supreme Court in October 2000 and permitted further raising of the dam up to 90.0 m and Narmada Control Authority (NCA) was directed to prepare an action plan for further raising of the dam pari-passu with completion of Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) and environmental safeguard measures. Accordingly, NCA formulated an action plan for further raising of the dam according to which, the dam was scheduled to be completed up to Full Reservoir Level (FRL) of 138.68 m by June 2005. However, owing to slow progress of Resettlement and Rehabilitation of project affected persons, the dam could be raised up to 121.92 m only by the end of December, 2006.(c) The estimated cost of the Sardar Sarovar Project as approved by the Planning Commission at 1986-87 price level was Rs. 6406.04 crore. According to the State Government of Gujarat, the estimated cost of the project at 2005-06 price level is Rs. 33822.60 crore.","minister","ls14","2007","200705","20070514","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2007","80346","177818","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrijaiprakashnarayanyadav","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2007","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2007","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2007","l14_nt_2007","inc_qna_2007","inc_nt_2007","other","n200705","l14_qna_200705","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","WaterResources","awhethertheSardarSarovarprojectamultiStateProjecthasbeendelayedduetovariousreasonsbifsothedetailsandreasonsthereforandctheestimatedcostatthetimeofitsoriginatingandthepresentestimatedcostoftheproject","newdelhi",233

Though no proposal for formation of any airline by the name `Air Kerala` is pending with the Government for clearance, the Government of Kerala had informed that a public limited company, `Air Kerala International Services Limited` has been registered as a Special Purpose Vehicle for a budget airline project. Government of Kerala requested this Ministry for exemption to the proposed airline from the stipulated conditions relating to fleet size and the length of operation in the domestic sector for an airline to be considered for international operations. This request was not considered in the light of the existing Government Policy regarding the minimum fleet size of 20 aircraft and experience of 5 years continuous operations in domestic sector for permitting an Indian scheduled carrier to operate international services.","minister","ls14","2008","200802","20080228","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2008","114977","186839","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","independentcharge","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2008","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2008","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2008","l14_nt_2008","inc_qna_2008","inc_nt_2008","other","n200802","l14_qna_200802","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","CivilAviation","awhethertheUnionGovernmenthavereceivedanyproposalfromtheStateGovernmenttostartBudgetairlinestooperateInternationalFlightsbifsothedetailsthereofStatewisecwhethertheGovernmentofKeralahadappliedforstartinganAirlinetooperateflightstoMiddleEastanddifsothedecisiontakenbytheUnionGovernmentinthisregard","newdelhi",161

"i546020","t20100224884408","  (a) The India-Pakistan Composite Dialogue process was paused after the terrorist attack on Mumbai on November 26, 2008. However, there have been a few meetings at the level of Prime Minister and Foreign Minister with Pakistan after the terrorist attack on Mumbai on November 26, 2008. In these meetings apart from asking Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai terrorist attack to justice, it was conveyed that any meaningful dialogue with Pakistan can only be based on fulfilment of its commitment, in letter and spirit, not to allow its territory to be used in any manner for terrorist activities against India. Pakistan has assured Government that it will do everything in its power to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack to justice.(b) to (c) Foreign Secretary level talks between India and Pakistan are scheduled to be held in New Delhi on February 25, 2010. The meeting of the Foreign Secretaries on February 25 is not a continuation of the Composite Dialogue Process. The proposed talks will focus essentially on Indias core concerns regarding terrorism. It is Governments consistently expressed position that it is necessary to have an environment free of terror or threat of terror if relations between the two countries are to move forward concretely and meaningfully. Government expects Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai terrorist attack to justice, unravel the full conspiracy behind the attack, fulfil its commitment to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism and to deny sanctuary to all terrorist groups which operate from its soil. Enabling an effective channel of communication between India and Pakistan can assist in the discussion of such concerns and to highlight the seriousness we attach to the need for action by Pakistan against terrorism.(d) to (f) Pakistan acknowledged and admitted on February 12, 2009 that the terrorist attack on Mumbai on November 26, 2008 was planned and launched from Pakistan. In its dossier of July 11, 2009, Pakistan also acknowledged that substantial incriminating evidence had been unearthed which directly connects five accused LeT operatives under Pakistani custody to the attacks in Mumbai. Two more suspects were arrested later. On November 25, 2009, the Government of Pakistan reportedly filed a charge sheet in an Anti Terrorism Court in Pakistan against the seven suspects and 20 proclaimed offenders for their role in the terrorist attack on Mumbai. The trial in Pakistan is on going.","minister","ls15","2010","201002","20100224","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2010","160797","208329","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrismkrishna","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2010","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2010","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2010","l15_nt_2010","inc_qna_2010","inc_nt_2010","other","n201002","l15_qna_201002","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","ExternalAffairs","athecurrentstatusoftheIndiaPakistannegotiationsonvariousbilateralissuesbwhetherthenegotiationshavebeenproposedbetweenthetwocountriesatForeignSecretarylevelrecentlycifsothedetailsthereofandthecircumstanceswhichhaveforcedtheGovernmenttoholdthetalkswithPakistandthepresentstatusofpersonsaccusedin2611MumbaiattacksinPakistanewhethertheGovernmenthastakenupthisissuewiththePakistanauthoritiesandfifsothedetailsandtheoutcomethereof","newdelhi",399

In my opinion you will be justified and you are bound after due
notice to the public and especially to the donors to hand over the
Gurukula property both movable and immovable to those who have
declared themselves the committee of management, if the committee
will not agree to arbitration.

The answers I have given to your questions are not to be
considered as legal opinion in any sense. They are merely answers
that common sense has dictated to me. And though I have no
objection whatsoever to your publishing the answers, I would much
rather that they were not, because I have no desire to be drawn into a
public controversy over any of the answers.

Yours sincerely,

For creating employment opportunities, providing access to basic needs and creating rural infrastructure, Ministry of Rural Development and Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation are implementing various rural development schemes namely Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act with the objective of providing guaranteed wage employment of 100 days in a financial year to a rural household whose adult members are willing to take up manual work; Swaranjyanati Gram Swarozgar Yojana/National Rural Livelihood Mission with the objectives to provide self- employment to the members of the rural poor families; Watershed Development Programmes for area development. Besides, Indira Awaas Yojana, National Rural Drinking Water Programme , Total Sanitation Campaign and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana are also implemented to provide access to basic needs and developing rural infrastructure for improving living conditions of rural masses.

"i12760","t19271013603543","Professor Malkani sends the following wire from Ahmedabad:
Proceeding Bombay meet Sir Purushottamdas. Help from Central Fund urgently
needed. Vallabhbhai promised support. Kripalani Vidyapith volunteers going Sind.
Sir M. Visvesvarayya is reported to have spoken as follows at the
opening of the All-India Swadeshi Bazaar and Industrial Exhibition at
Poona on the 3rd instant.
If my voice can have any influence with the universities, I would beg
them, so long as our present economic inefficiency continues, to restrict
admissions to literary and theoretical courses and induce the student
population to covet degrees in agriculture, engineering, technology and
commerce.
Whilst Sir M. Visvesvarayya has emphasized one grave defect of
our present education which places exclusive emphasis on literary
merit, I would add a graver defect in that students are made to think
that whilst they are pursuing their literary studies, they may not do
acts of service at the sacrifice of their studies, be it ever so small or
temporary. They will lose nothing and gain much if they would
suspend their education, literary or industrial, in order to do relief
work, such as is being done by some of them in Gujarat. The end of
all education should surely be service, and if a student gets an
opportunity of rendering service even whilst he is studying, he should
consider it as a rare opportunity and treat it not really as a suspension
of his education but rather its complement. I therefore heartily
welcome the idea of the students of the Gujarat National College
extending their works of service beyond the confines of Gujarat. I
remarked only the other day that we must not become narrowly
provincial. Sind is not so well organized for producing an army of
relief workers as Gujarat is. It is therefore expected of Gujarat to send
volunteers to Sind or any other province wherever their services can
be utilized. And after all, Gujarat in general and Gujarat national
students in particular owe a debt to Sind in that she sent in the course
of the Non-co-operation movement three distinguised educationists—
Acharya Gidwani, Acharya Kripalani and Adhyapak1 Malkani. If
therefore Gujarat students will go to Sind, they will do nothing but a
simple duty.

HELP FROM KANGRI GURUKUL
The response received by Gujarat to the appeal for help in her
distress has been most gratifying. Among the early helpers were two
institutions that I should like to mention, Gurukul Kangri and
Shantiniketan, and knowing how their gitts will delight my heart they
even sent telegrams to me advising me of their donations, which were
sent directly to Sjt. Vallabhbhai Patel. Acharya Ramdevji sends me
particulars regarding the four instalments sent on behalf of the
Gurukul. He tells me that even more may be expected, and adds:
The teachers have paid a percentage from their salaries, the brahmacharis
have saved money by washing their own clothes instead of having them
washed by dhobis as is done usually, and the brahmacharinis of the girls’
school have saved money by giving up ghee and milk for a time.
Let those in Gujarat who are receiving relief and who are
distributing relief remember what self-denial lies behind some of the
donations received. The present self-denial of the Gurukul boys and
girls reminds me of the practice of self-denial first in- augurated by
the late Swami Shraddhanandji when he was Governor of the Gurukul,
for helping our countrymen in South Africa during satyagraha there.
Such acts of self-sacrifice are therefore what one would always expect
on given occasions from boys and girls brought up in the traditions of
the Gurukul.

ABOUT COW-PROTECTION PRIZE ESSAY
The reader will recall that in Young India of October 29, 1925, I
published a note offering on behalf of Sjt. Revashanker Jagjivan
Jhaveri a prize of Rs. 1,000 for the best essay on cow-protection in
English, Sanskrit or Hindi, and similarly in Navajivan for December
13, 1925 a prize of Rs. 251 was announced on behalf of Sjt. Tulsidas
Khimji for the best essay on the same subject in Gujarati. These were
the terms:
The essay should be delivered at Satyagraha Ashram, Sabarmati, to the
Secretary, All-India Cow-Protection Association, on or before March 31st
1926. (The time was since extended to 31st May). . . . It should deal with the
origin, meaning and implications of cow-protection quoting texts in support.
It should contain an examination of the Shastras and find whether there is any
prohibition in the Shastras for conducting dairies and tanneries by association
interested in cow-protection. It should trace the history of cow-protection in
India and methods adopted to achieve it from time to time. It should contain
statistics giving the number of cattle in India and examine the question of
pasture land and the effect of Government policy about pasture land in India
and suggest remedy to be adopted for securing cow-protection.
Acharya Anandashankar Bapubhai Dhruva, Sjt. Chintamani
Vinayak Vaidya and Sjt. Valji Govindji Desai were appointed judges.
I regret to announce that the judges have independently of one
another come to the conclusion that no essay has been found to be
worthy of the prize in terms of its conditions. I am sorry for the delay
in announcing the result of the competition for causes into which it is
unnecessary to go. But I would ask those who have studied the
question and who are interested in this important question to attempt
an essay worthy of this subject. Let those who competed for the prize
try again. The judges inform me that some competitors do give
evidence of industry but they are of opinion that even these have not
given to the subject the diligent research that it deserves and that
hardly any has kept himself to the conditions laid down winning the
prize.

Whilst the prize should be deemed as withdrawn, if any worthy
attempt is made and the essays sent to the secretary, I do not anticipate
any difficulty in inducing the judges to examine the essays or the
donors to give the prizes if any essay is found worthy. If enough
competitors send their names and qualifications in advance of their
intention to make or remake the attempts, I hope to be able to
reannounce the prizes, the conditions of course being the same as
before.

Prabhashankar used to treat your advice as sacred word, and that
lightened my burden, too. Your letters throw a new light on  the
situation. You should now put this business  on the right lines as
Ratilal’s  lawyer,  friend  of  the Mehta family  and  lover  of  justice.
I shall  be  able  to do very little from here. Think over this. Ratilal

Prabhashankar. They will do exactly as he desires. To Ratilal he is in
the place of a father. Irrespective of what we consider to be right, how
can we shake Ratilal’s and Champa’s faith in what they believe to be
right? Please think over all these factors and then guide me. If you are
unable to do anything besides writing to me, then please permit me to
make use of your letters or write to me a letter such as I can use. I do
not wish to take any step till I have your reply to this letter.

"i82020","t20200105150348"," When we get into arguments and a lot of negative discussions
 There will be such a deep entanglement of our energy with their energy
 They will certainly be depleted anyway. But along with them we also get depleted.
 To protect ourselves from people's energies, we need to withdraw ourselves.
 Withdrawal doesn't mean we stop talking to them or stop meeting them.
 Withdrawal means we withdraw our energy
 And we need to give only and only high vibration energy to them.
 Can we send good energy to someone who is sending us wrong energy?
 Can we send it? Yes?
 Just create one thought everyday and you will get wonderful results.
 Every morning when you pray or meditate
 Just create one thought and visualise it. Let's do it now.
 Visualise that God's purity, power are coming on to me as rays.
 And it has created a circle around me.
 We need to create our own protective shield.
 God's purity and power
 Makes a circle of energy around me.
 Then create a thought - Within this circle, nobody else's thought can enter.
 Nobody thought can enter my energy circle.
 Whose energy is the only energy that I have?
 Whose energy am I surrounded by?
 By God's power and blessings.
 Create a very form thought. These are just 2 thoughts which can change our destiny.
 If we create a thought - Nobody's thought can enter my energy circle.
 That is one thought.
 But if we create a thought - Everyone I meet seems to have a problem with me.
 There are two completely different thoughts.
 So the circle of God's purity and power surrounding me
 Nobody else's thought can enter inside this energy circle.
 I have only and only the energy received from God.
 And what is the energy they will get from me?
 What is the energy that will radiate from me to them?
 God's energy which is present in my energy circle, is what radiates to them. Finished.
 I am also safe. You are also safe.
 We can do this everyday.
 We can do it for our family
 We can do it for our children and for our home everyday.
 Just like how we set up electric fence so that no one can enter inside it.
 Create an electric fence with your mind.
 That God's purity and power are circled around my house.
 Not just anyone's negative energy, but no other energy
 No other energy can enter my house.
 My house has only God's energy in it.
 And my house radiates only that energy.
 Protect yourself, protect your children
 Protect your circle, protect your home
 Even when you sit in your car, create that thought and protect your car.
 Nobody can touch your vehicle and create a dent thereafter.
 Because that circle does not let any negativity reach it.
 That is one way of living.
 Another way of living is to just leave our energies open.
 And then we fill it with everyone's energy
 Thereby we deplete our energy.
 The power is here in the mind. It depends on what we are thinking here.
 Can we do it now? Create a thought and see it happening.
 Energy is only a thought.
 And that is why we have to be very careful with our every thought.
 Our one thought can take us to a very elevated state.
 And other one thought can take our vibration to a very low frequency.
 So think very carefully.
 Now together we will see
 We will create thoughts and let us say it together.
 God's purity
 Power
 Let us say it together so that it gets recorded.
 God's purity
 Power
 Blessings
 Is a very beautiful circle around me.
 See that circle around you.
 Very high vibration, Pure white circle around me.
 This is my protection shield.
 Now say - Nobody's thought can enter inside the circle.
 From me they will get
 Only and only
 God's blessings.
 I am protected.
 They are safe.
 Simple. Destiny changed.
 Can we do this everyday?
 Can we do it for our home?
 Can we do it for our family? Yes.
 The biggest protection lies here.
 There has been research conducted
 It is a study that the accidents that happened
 From the study it is evident that the accidents that happen on road
 It happens with those people who think - I hope I don't meet with an accident.
 People who overthink that they should not fall ill, their chances of falling ill is high.
 This is a law of energy, of vibration.
 Whatever we think is the energy we radiate.
 Thoughts create our reality.
 Thoughts manifest thoughts become a reality.
 So we need to think carefully.
 We don't need to speak carefully but before that we need to think carefully.
 If we think carefully, then we don't need to pay attention on what we speak.
 Because it is our thoughts which come out into words.
 So my every thought affects my feelings, health and relationship.
 And the last stage or last effect of thoughts is on?
 It first reached our feelings, our health, our relationships
 Lastly where does it reach?
 Into the environment.
 Today if we need to check the energy of this hall
 How can it be checked?
 There are 2,000 minds seated in this hall right now.
 If you put 2,000 minds together
 Whatever will be the state of the combined minds
 That is the energy of this hall.
 We call this collective consciousness.
 How can we check the energy of Hyderabad?
 The state of mind of everyone residing in Hyderabad.
 Go to a small village
 Where life is simple, there is no hurry, no worry, nothing much happening.
 Where people are very easy and light.
 How will the energy of that village be?
 It will be different.
 When will leave the city and go to that village
 We will be influenced by the energy of that village.
 How will we start feeling? Easy.
 We create the collective consciousness.
 Whether it is the energy of our house
 Energy of our office
 Energy of our city
 Energy of our country
 Or energy of our world.
 So my mind creates my world.
 If I want to change my world
 I will have to change my?
 If I have to change the world
 I will have to change my mind.
 That is why it is the seed.
 This is the seed and the rest is our tree.
 Today we are putting effort and working on the tree.
 Our health, our relationships, our work - We are working on the tree.
 Will it take longer to water the tree or to water the seed?
 Seed?
 Which one takes longer to water - the tree or the seed?
 The tree takes longer to be washed. We need to wash every leaf, every fruit, every flower.
 We water the side of the tree and the other side gets dried by then.
 Which means you take care of the office and your family gets angry.
 You take one day holiday for your family and your colleagues get angry.
 The tree can never be happy. Somebody or the other will be angry or upset all the time.
 So we need to water the seed.
 But sometimes unaware, we say -
 I have no time for myself.
 There are three aspects to life: self, family, and work.
 What should be the sequence?
 Self, family, work? 
Work, family, self?
 Work, family, self?
 No.
 Family, work, self?
 No.
 Self, family, work?
 Yes.
 We know everything. We just need to start doing it from today.
 Which means water the seed - the self.
 Which means take care of the mind.
 There are two ways of living.
 Either situation will influence our state of mind.
 Our mind will influence our situation.
 Which one is true?
 Our mind affects situation?
 Or situations affect our mind?
 Which one is true?
 How many of us get affected by the situation?
 Upstairs?
 What is the equation?
 Who is creating the situation?
 I am creating the situation.
 If I allow the situation to overpower me
 Please have this very clear and then use it every time.
 If I allow the situation to overpower me
 I lose my power to overpower the situation.
 Between the two, who will overpower whom?
 If I allow the situation to overpower me
 What will happen to my power of handling the situation?
 So whenever there is a situation in life
 Immediately we need to minimise the situation and make ourselves bigger.
 What should we do for that?
 Whenever there is a situation what should we say about its size?
 What is the size of the situation?
 We need to make the situation small and rise above it.
 So what is the size of the situation? What should we say about it?
 Just look at your own home. Whenever there is an issue
 One family member will say it is such a big issue.
 There is such a big problem at home.
 The second family member will say yes, there is an issue.
 There is an issue at home.
 The third family member will say it is such a small thing after all. Nothing big at all.
 The fourth family member will say where is issue? I don't see any issue.
 Where is the problem? This is just a part of life.
 So whether it is a huge crisis, a big problem
 A problem, a small problem
 Or not a problem at all
 Why do problems have different weights like this?
 Because it depends on my power.
 Somebody will say this is a very heavy table.
 Somebody will say it is heavy.
 Somebody will say it is just table, and the other will say it is very light.
 Depending on how physically strong they are.
 If you want to reduce the magnitude of the situation
 So never call it as such a big problem
 As soon as you say that, the situation will overpower you.
 So immediately what should you say and do?
 The line is that our thoughts create our reality. So be careful of the first thought.
 As soon as there is a situation, the first thought
 What should be the thought? What is the size of the situation?
 Let us prepare the thought today itself.
 What thought will you create as soon as there's a situation?
 There is no problem at all.
 God teaches us
 Some people make a mountain out of a situation.
 And then they keep looking at that mountain they created, and keep getting scared.
 First they themselves convert it into a mountain, with their thoughts.
 And then they keep getting scared by looking at that mountain.
 Look at the equation God is teaching us
 Convert a mountain into a mustard seed.
 Convert it into a mustard seed.
 Convert the mountain into a mustard seed.
 And then convert that mustard seed into cotton.
 And then blow that cotton away.
 That is the power of our thoughts.
 But if we don't take care of our thoughts
 Even a simple thing like if she said one line to me
 When I go up to another person and the way I say about it to her will decide my feeling.
 Do you even know what happened today?
 The other person will be wondering what is it she wants to convey.
 This is how we magnify the problem.
 Our mind has the power
 It can either magnify the problem
 Or whatever is the size of the problem, the mind can look at it at that same size.
 Or the mind can make the problem very small.
 All those lenses are here.
 So whenever you are thinking about the situation
 Or sharing about it with someone
 First of all, check your language.
 Never say - Do you know how big the problem is?
 Do you know what they did? After that do you know what happened?...
 This energy
 Allows the other person to overpower us.
 And our capacity gets finished.
 Our capacity to take the problem in our hands and finish it.
 Even if somebody has done the most terrible thing that they can do to you.
 And even if the whole world tells you that they were so wrong to you.
 Tell them - Nothing has happened, there is no problem.
 Such small things keep happening in life. What is there in it?
 Even the other person becomes quiet with this response of yours.
 Bring down the energy, bring down the situation, bring down the negativity of the other person.
 And elevate your own state of mind much higher.
 When the state of mind is elevated, there can be no obstacle in life.
 But when we deplete our energy
 And magnify the situation that is in front of us
 Then gradually, every scene of life will start seeming very big.
 Does it happen or not?
 How many of you have met people who magnify situations while narrating them to you?
 Don't they magnify?
 Some people magnify about their health.
 Some people magnify their work related issues.
 Some other people magnify issues in their relationship.
 Somebody had a small difference of opinion in their house today.
 When they are sharing it with the other person they will say
 They just can't get along. Everyday there is an issue with them.
 They always are like this. We add the word ""always"" very casually.
 Never do that. Every word carries certain energy.
 Suppose that sister get angry once in 5 days.
 If I think she gets angry everyday.
 And then if I go and tell someone that she is such an angry person
 Whenever you see her, she is angry.
 Actually she would get angry only once in 5 days.
 Can you see how the interpretation can go on?
 Can you see how energy is getting multiplied?
 I speak like this
 I will share it with them, they will add something more to it
 And they will say she cannot live without getting angry

"i571782","t20110818416802"," IN THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF THE STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS (SHRI SRIKANT KUMAR JENA)  (a) & (b): There are no guidelines issued by the Government for appointment of dealers which is done by the respective fertilizer manufacturing/trading company looking to its commercial requirement and marketing needs in different States of the country. The licence for distributorship is given by the respective State Government. Urea is the only fertilizer under partial movement, distribution and statutory price control of Government of India. All other fertilizers viz. DAP, MOP, SSP and NPK etc.are decontrolled/ de-canalized since 1992 and are imported under Open General Licence (OGL). The availability of these P&K fertilizers is decided by the market forces of demand and supply. Union Government monitors availability of fertilizers at State level and State Governments are responsible for further distribution within the State. The availability of urea, phosphatic fertilizers (DAP/NPK) and MOP in Punjab during current Kharif`2011 (April`11 to July`11) are as under:           (Figures in `000 MTs)      Kharif 2011 (April`11 to July`11)  Fertilizer  Requirement  Stock pre- Supplies Availability Sales Grade      positioned  Urea   1050.00     1069.24  1069.24  1049.05  Phosphate(DAP+NPK) 360.00   51.95  246.98  298.93  293.50  MOP   36.00     19.40  19.40  19.37  The State-wise demand (Requirement), supply (Availability) and sales of majoi fertilizers namely Urea, MOP and phosphatic fertilizers (DAP+NPK) during the current Kharif, 2011 (April`11 to July`11) is annexed at `A`. As can be seen, the availability of urea is adequate. Similarly, the availability of phosphatic fertilisers i.e. DAP/NPK during current Kharif, 2011 (Aprim to July`11) has been comfortable throughout the country. There is tightness in availability of MOP during current year. There is no viable source of Potash in the country as such the entire demand of MOP is met thrdugh imports. During the current year, contracting for import of MOP could not be materialized due to substantial increase of prices in the International market. However, the breakthrough in contracting of MOP has just been achieved. It is expected that MOP imports would start arriving with effect from first week of September, 2011 As a result, MOP availability for direct application as well as for indigenous production of NPK fertilizers would improve.(c): The State-wise number of fertilizer dealership/distributorship of M/s National Fertilizer Limited and M/s Indian Potash Limited in the country during the last three years is annexed at `B`.(d): The steps taken for smooth distribution of fertilizers are as under:  (i) The movement of all major subsidized fertilizers is being monitored throughout the country by an on- line web based monitoring system (www.urvarak.co.in) also called as Fertiliser Monitoring System (FMS);  (ii) The state governments have been advised  (i) to instruct the State Institutional agencies to coordinate with manufacturers and importers of fertilizers for streamlining the supplies  (ii) to review the railway rake points in their states and take up the issues with the Railways for improvements, if any, required to ensure availability of fertilizers in every nook and corner of the State;  (iii) The Government has introduced Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) Policy in respect of Phosphatic & Potassic fertilizers w.e.f. 1.4. 2010. Under the NBS, State Governments have to play more proactive role to co-ordinate with the manufacturers/importers to tie up supplies of fertilizers as per the requirement of states;  (iv) Department of Fertilizers and Department of Agriculture & Cooperation are jointly reviewing fertilizer availability with State Agriculture department through Video Conferences every week. The corrective actions, if required, are taken immediately to avoid any hardships to farmers;  (v) Under NBS, Fertilizer companies are required to print Maximum Retail Price (MRP) along with applicable subsidy on the fertilizer bags clearly. Any sale above the printed net retail price will be punishable under the EC Act.; and  (vi) All possible steps are taken by the Department of Fertilisers to match the availability of fertilizers with the assessed requirement.","minister","ls15","2011","201108","20110818","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2011","152414","234091","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","independentcharge","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2011","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2011","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2011","l15_nt_2011","inc_qna_2011","inc_nt_2011","other","n201108","l15_qna_201108","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","ChemicalsandFertilizers","awhethertheGovernmentproposestoincreasethedealershipnetworkoffertilizerunitsinviewofsevereshortageoffertilizersinseveralpartsofthecountryincludingPunjabbifsothedetailsthereofcthenumberoffertilizerdealershipdistributorshipofNationalFertilizersLtdandIndianPotashLtdinthecountryincludingPunjabduringthelastthreeyearsStatewiseanddtheotherstepsproposedtobetakenbytheGovernmentfortheeffectivedistributionoffertilizersandpreventitsshortageinthemarket","newdelhi",683

"i2072","t19070817163457","The Natal Government Gazette has published a Bill which, if
passed, will require every merchant intending to sell his business or
shop to give a fortnight’s notice through the Gazette and a local
newspaper. A similar notice will also have to be published by anyone
desiring to take out a new licence. Both these provisions are harsh, but
it will not be possible for the Indian community to oppose them as
they apply to all. The same Bill also includes another provision to the
effect that, unless a special contract exists, it will not be competent for
a court of law to allow more than eight per cent interest on
time-barred debts. A contract will not be nullified on the ground that

"i49256","t19751028571474","IT IS APT that this association should meet in our capital city which witnessed the signing of instruments marking the beginning of the end of colonialism. Here was born the singular and remarkable concept of a new Commonwealth which owes much to the genius of Jawaharlal Nehru and that of the Indian people which he symbolised. He wanted the new relationship to be based not on animosity and bitter memories, but on forgiveness and friendship. The special feature of the association is the voluntary coming together of countries of diverse continents and cultural, economic and social life–styles. It is not bound by any stated or unstated political obligations. It is neither confined to any particular system nor dominated by any one individual or nation. It has proved a useful forum for the exchange of ideas and experiences.

Mr. Ramphal's election as the Secretary–General of the Commonwealth is itself an example of the developing role of the Commonwealth. I offer him our greetings and wish him success in his task. We, on our part, assure him our full support and co–operation.

For all the agony it caused, the imperial connection brought us acquaintance with Europe's political and scientific ideas. India has always been known for her assimilative faculty, for the ability to transmute other's experience into her own. In framing our Constitution, we may have drawn upon the experience of some Commonwealth countries and of other democracies. But what brought our Constitution into being and provided the motive power for its functioning is our own will and our own spirit, shaped through long years of struggle and suffering.

That struggle was possibly the greatest mass movement the world has known. We had no money, no resources, no weapons. It was one of the miracles of our age that a people humiliated, enveloped in misery and hopelessness were roused out of their apathy by Mahatma Gandhi and imbued with a sense of purpose which cut across divisions of status, wealth, religion, language or sex. India became free because we willed and worked to be free. In 1922, Mahatma Gandhi said that Swaraj or self–government “will not be a gift of the British Parliament. It will be a declaration of India's full expression. That it will be expressed through an Act of Parliament is true. But it will be merely a courteous ratification of the declared wish of the Indian nation.” And that is what happened in 1947.

The involvement of so many millions in the national struggle made it inevitable that free India should shun any path reserved for a few. It had to be participatory democracy on the broadest base. We opted for this system not to emulate Britain or because the framers of the Indian Constitution were unaware of other forms of democracy, but because it was best suited to the Indian reality. It was a deliberate choice and was determined by the non–violent nature of our fight, by our preference for peaceful and orderly change and by our conviction that the people must have the deciding voice.

There was an opinion in favour of limited franchise based on educational or properly qualifications. But would this have been fair to the masses of our people who owned little or no property? And can literacy, important though it is, and consciously being extended, itself be regarded as synonymous with character and political discretion? We felt that the oral tradition of great antiquity and of values handed down from generation to generation, gave our people cultural literacy and depth of judgement. The objective of our freedom movement had been not merely political liberation but the eradication of poverty and disparity, and the breaking down of the outmoded apparatus of superstition, privilege and hierarchy. Adult franchise is the most effective instrument for the people to safeguard their rights. Within a few years of the promulgation of the Constitution, we also revived our ancient democractic tradition of rural self–government by which elected village councils or Panchayats exercise a variety of political functions at the grass roots level.

Democracy is a generic term. The forms of democracy vary in each country, in the light of its own history and national character, its size, the diversity or homogeneity of its population, the state of its economic development and other such conditioning factors. In the post–colonial period, many members of the Commonwealth adopted the British model of Government, but later adapted it to their own circumstances. Constitutions are not static. Even as our own was being passed, Jawaharlal Nehru, with remarkable perspicacity, said, “A free India will see the bursting forth of the energy of a mighty nation. What it will do and what it will not, I do not know, but I do know that it will not consent to be bound down by anything. Some people imagine that what we do now may not be touched for 10 years or 20 years... I should like the House to consider that we are on the eve of revolutionary changes, revolutionary in every sense of the word because when the spirit of a nation breaks its bonds, it functions in peculiar ways and it should function in strange ways. It may be that the Constitution this House may frame may not satisfy that free India. This House cannot bind down the next generation or the people who will duly succeed us in this task.”

With far–sighted wisdom Jawaharlal Nehru was asserting that constitutions are made for peoples, not the other way around, and that democracy is not a rigid and immutable concept. Sometimes, nations tend to think that their type of democracy is of universal applicability. They forget that it evolved over time and that what was good enough for the founders is no longer good enough for them. Conceivably, their future generations will re–examine their systems in the light of new historic conditions.

Small countries, which have the advantage of ethnic, religious and linguistic cohesiveness and of a long period of stability, cannot easily visualize the tensions that continuously arise in our land. We have 22 States and nine Union Territories, most of which are larger than the bigger nation–states of the world. Parenthetically, the total population of all the countries represented in this conference is just about one–third of India's. We have almost every religious faith in the world, more than a dozen major languages, each with their own scripts and ancient literatures and widely differing levels of economic development. Regional loyalties and urges must constantly be balanced with the need to maintain and strengthen national unity, integrity and stability. Through its federal provisions, our Constitution gives our States a great deal of power, but it also endows the Centre with authority to deal effectively with any external danger or internal disturbance.

In the last 25 years, we have withstood more than one military challenge, economic crisis and threat of secession. Our five general elections have demonstrated the value of free vote and the maturity of our electorate (which, in the 1971 Parliamentary Election numbered 274 million). The people have voted for secularism, even though it was believed and propagated that Indian politics were dominated by religious factions and sentiments. They have rejected the appeal of the extreme right and of the extreme left, of reactionaries and of ultra–revolutionaries, and have supported the democratic middle path to socialist development.

At the time of the Industrial Revolution in Europe and North America, there was no adult franchise nor recognition of the rights of the workers. Industries were built and capital was accumulated by the crass exploitation of men, women and children of their own countries as well as of others across the seas. The need for skilled labour introduced education which, in turn, brought demands for better conditions and greater equality. However, by then the economic base was strong enough to meet these demands. But in India and other newly–freed countries, this so–called historical process has been reversed.

With political freedom, long suppressed desires and needs came to surface in the shape of clamour for self–expression and economic betterment. And the people were impatient, although we were still very far from any capacity to satisfy them. We did know of systems which had succeeded in accelerating economic growth through regimentation. Yet we chose the more difficult path of change through civil liberties. In 25 years, our experience has not disproved our belief. Democracy has not inhibited or slowed down our industrialization or modernization. Poverty could not go in a few years and there are many outward signs of it. Much is wanting in our system of distribution. We are very conscious of our failings. Nevertheless, there is remarkable progress in agricultural production and the strengthening and diversification of our industrial base. When compared to the achievements of authoritarian regimes, we can claim that there is no significant difference in economic growth.

The ushering in of a democratic system, the adoption of a free Constitution and the establishment of a Parliamentary Government do not necessarily guarantee consensus and order. The need for vigilance is constant. Not everyone may agree on democracy, not everyone may understand its functioning, not everyone may wish to see it win through. Where a strong mass party has not only succeeded in wining freedom but goes on to inspire the overwhelming majority of the people with its vision and ability, frustrations may grow among the other contenders.

Democracy is not just an ideal or an objective. It is a method through which a country tries to manage its affairs. In a developing society this inevitably means taking measures for social and economic transformation which are bound to upset one section or another. Any system can prevail only so long as it keeps pace with changing conditions and proves its ability to solve the problems of its people. When the majority is struggling for survival, will they tolerate luxury for a few, either material or in the form of licence to do whatever they wish? The essential is: to what extent a party or its alternatives can truly reflect the wishes and aspirations of the people. Over the years, some democracies have evolved a polarisation in which only two effective parties are politically active. But does a deviation from this rule dilute the essence of democracy?

The inability to accede to power by democratic means may lead some parties to offer unconstitutional or extra–constitutional challenges. For young democracies, it is imperative to guard against such developments. It then becomes an onerous, if not painful, duty to counter them by constitutional remedies. The responsibility for preserving democracy is not confined to the ruling party, but devolves equally on the parties of the opposition and the people as a whole.

Social and economic problems are far more complex today than in the mid–19th century and the early 20th when the theoretical framework of liberalism and Marxism were developed. Even in Britain and the United States, there is a debate whether the framework of their democracies will withstand the new economic pressures.

None of us dwells only in one country. We are all citizens of a common humanity. In what is termed as a shrinking world, technological, economic and political forces are global, transcending national boundaries. Theories of political organisation and economic management have not wholly caught up with this reality. Some situations are rather puzzling. If there is dust because roads are not tarred or cemented, it is a sign of backwardness. But if the dust comes from factories, it is a sign of progress. If millions of pounds worth of food is destroyed in Europe it is advanced economic management. But if some of our grains or other foodstuffs are damaged because of lack of resources to build sufficient storage or have refrigeration, it is inefficiency.

It is because of our long national experience that India put forward the idea of co–existence. There cannot be harmony without the acceptance of the right of even the smallest nation to follow its own path. But independence does not mean isolation. We must work for interdependence on the basis of equality to advance the cause of understanding, co–operation and peace. Our age is one of uncertainty. Everywhere there is a searching for fulfilment.

Welcome to India, a strange land, strange not only to those who have come from abroad but even to many who have lived here all their lives. My father, steeped in India's history and culture, spent a lifetime discovering her. India is a world in herself–in space and in time. You can see any one part and because of its vastness consider it the whole, yet it remains only a part. The convergence of centuries and the interplay of the clinging past with the transient present and the ever pressing future is even more difficult to comprehend. As there is unity in diversity, so is there simplicity in our complexity. This simplicity eludes those who cannot think beyond analytical frameworks and pre–conceived notions. Yet impatient with the complexity, they tend towards a superficial and over–simplified view of issues and events.

We wish not merely to satisfy the material comforts of our people but also to liberate them for creative and contemplative pursuits. We believe, as Mahatma Gandhi taught, that rights flow from duty well done. We believe that the freedom of each man is inseparable from that of his fellow–men. Inescapably this implies that within his freedom and the bounds of duty he may develop at his own pace and in his own way, be different yet suffer no discrimination.

Through all the ups and downs of our long history, its cycles of fortune and misfortune, its moments of liberty and bondage, we have never been beggared of our spirit which we see as the quintessential humanness of man. We conceive of a society that is in harmony with itself and its environs of a world that is rid of conflict and is busy in the great arts of peace. In our world–view, all turbulence ends in order, all conflict ends in resolution, all travail ends in tranquility. And man emerges and lives on for larger purpose. That is our unceasing quest.

"i572108","t20110819774490","  (a) to (d) : Transmission & Distribution (T&D) losses as measure of grid losses were replaced with Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses for better clarity. AT&C losses have been reduced from 36.64% in year 2002-03 to 27.15% in year 2009-10. Details are placed at Annex. The responsibility of reduction of losses in the distribution network lies with the State Governments and the Power Departments/Utilities. Losses taking place in distribution system also contribute to the losses of the State Electricity Boards and power distribution companies. According to M/s Mercados Report on `Study on Specific Aspects of the Power Sector for Impact on State Finances` submitted to the Thirteenth Finance Commission, Govt.of India, the projected losses at constant nominal tariffs and without considering the subsidies have been worked out as Rs.116,089 crores for the year 2014-15. The primary reasons for (a) Commercial losses are operational inefficiency, leading to high AT&C losses, inadequate revision of tariff to cover cost of supply, pilferage/theft of power and non- disbursement of subsidy by State Governments to utilities, and (b) technical losses are overloaded networks, inadequate neutralization of reactive power by capacitors, load imbalances in 3 phase supply etc.(e) & (f): Yes, Madam, a High Level Panel on `Financial Position of Distribution Utilities` to look into the financial problems of the State Electricity Boards (SEBs) and to recommend system improvement measures has been constituted by the Planning Commission under the chairmanship of Shri V.

STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) & (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.3551 BY SHRI KAMLA PRASAD RAWAT TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 18. 08.2005 REGARDING INTERNAL RESOURCES FOR DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF PROJECTS.(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. Efforts are being made to generate internal resources by increasing the earnings and managing the expenditure. As regards increasing the earnings, the initiatives taken under freight business segment include plans to improve throughput through increased productivity and efficiency, reduction in wagon turn around time, simplification and rationalization of preferential traffic schedule, electrification of diesel sidings, engine-on-load scheme, terminal incentive scheme, introduction of electronic payment gateway facility, simplification and rationalization of goods tariff, new premium registration scheme, wagon investment scheme, development of private sidings through cost sharing, integrated warehouse complexes, etc. Initiatives under passenger and parcel business segments include extension of Passenger Reservation System (PRS) and Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) facilities to more and more locations, speeding up of trains, review of trains with low patronage, deployment of additional coaches in well patronized trains, additional leasing of parcel space in certain nominated trains, leasing of vacant compartment of guard in front of SLR coach, etc. Similarly, it has been a constant endeavour on the part of the Railways to avoid wasteful expenditure and control the growth of the non-plan expenditure. The Railways have been taking a number of austerity/economy measures such as improving staff productivity by better man-power planning, asset utilization, inventory management, fuel consumption etc.to keep the expenditure under control. These efforts have resulted in increased internal resource generation of the Railways and the same facilitated an increased appropriation to various funds by Rs.1861 cr.over the budgeted figure of Rs.10140 cr.in 2004-05. It also enabled the Railways to discharge the deferred dividend liability by Rs.483 cr. Further, the Operating Ratio for 2004-05, which broadly indicates the financial health of the system, improved to 90.98% as against budgeted projections of 92.58%. In the first quarter of current fiscal also, earnings show a substantial growth of Rs.700 cr.vis- a-vis proportionate targets, indicating a healthy growth of 16.7% over the corresponding period of the previous year.","minister","ls14","2005","200508","20050818","ndaupa","na","upa1","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2005","98190","152054","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrirvelu","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l14_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l14_nt","l14_upa1","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa1","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa1","min2005","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa1","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14","min","others","l14_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l14_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l14_upa1","min_upa1","o_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l14","nt","qna","na","inc_l14","inc_qna","inc_upa1","inc_nt","lib_l14","lib_qna","lib_upa1","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2005","lib_inc_qna","l14_qna_2005","l14_nt_2005","inc_qna_2005","inc_nt_2005","other","n200508","l14_qna_200508","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_qna","l14_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","l14","X","X","X","X","Railways","awhethertheRailwayshavemadeanyeffortstogenerateinternalresourcesforthedevelopmentandexpansionofitsprojectsandbifsothedetailsalongwiththeresultsachievedasaresultthereof","newdelhi",381
"i42466","t19460912873913","Actionary that Harijan has been publishing already exists
and asks why there should be another.  If the question has substance I
should think that Harijan’s labour is wasted.  If such a work exists it
will cause me surprise and pain that none of my co-workers told me
about it or themselves knew of its existence.  I am making enquiries
and have asked for a copy of the dictionary that has been mentioned.
If I find I have made a mistake I shall set it right and save the labour.
Another friend, writing in English, has said the same thing and
added that my Hindustani is in fact Urdu and it is making me more
and more unpopular in the Hindi world.  The same is true of the Urdu
world, only for the opposite reason.  The charge here is that  in the
name of Hindustani I am introducing into Urdu words from  Hindi,
that is Sanskrit.  I welcome both charges.  My Hindustani is neither
Urdu nor Hindi.  It is the mingling of the two.  The Saraswati that is to
flow from the confluence of these two is still invisible. Scholars tell
me that at one time it had become visible and then it disappeared.  Be
that as it may.  The idea behind Hindustani Prachar is that the two
languages, which have the same grammar but derive their vocabulary
from two different sources should not remain separate but should
mingle and flow as one stream.  Whether the effort will succeed or not
will depend upon the zeal of those working for it.  If they put some
vigour in their efforts they will not go in vain.  In the end of course
success is in the hands of God.  And where He is the Doer and the
Destroyer, what cause is there for grief and sorrow?
And is the purpose of the effort to gain popularity?  A public
servant is not flattered by praise nor frightened by censure.  He who
swells with applause and droops with criticism  cannot render service.
The reward of the worker lies in the work he does.  I would   therefore
request my critics that, rather than criticize me, they should help in
this noble cause and enlarge and enrich the language written and
spoken by the masses of such a vast country as India.  Then both  the
sister languages Hindi and Urdu will shine and India will advance.  It
will not offend God if I call Him Khuda or Ishwar and my knowledge
of that Supreme Power will increase. What quarrel can one have  with
a person who respects both the languages and wants to unite the two?

deaf people also should have the restoration?2 And how would it
benefit humanity? Do you know that Beethoven the great musician
was deaf? You are worrying about nothing. But that is my view. You
must do what you think is best for you.
In your place I should welcome this deafness. You are spared
much useless hearing. There is no harm in friends writing what they
wish to tell you .

A number of Indian students were questioned and 18 of them, facing investigation in case, were initially detained and then released with radio monitoring devices on their ankles. A vast majority of the students enrolled at the TVU were from the State of Andhra Pradesh.(c) The Government has repeatedly raised with the U. S. Government, including during the recent visits of External Affairs Minister and the Foreign Secretary, its strong concerns about radio tagging, welfare of the students and their academic future in the United States.(d) The United States Government has begun progressively removing radio collars from 18 students and has conveyed that it would seek to provide innocent students an adequate opportunity to transfer to other universities, adjust their status or, otherwise, leave the country honourably.(e) Our Mission and Posts in the United States are regularly meeting students and providing appropriate guidance and advisories. A free legal aid camp for the affected students was also organized in San Francisco.(f) The Government expects the US Government to take steps to prevent such universities from being set up and exploiting foreign students. Government also hopes that Indian students will exercise due vigilance in applying to foreign universities.","minister","ls15","2011","201102","20110223","ndaupa","na","upa2","nationalpol","qanda","na","na","na","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hioren","na","na","ls2011","152745","227527","notrans","rahul","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","loksabha","others","others","others","others","shrismkrishna","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","l15_qna","na","yes","others","mixed","inc","l15_nt","l15_upa2","inc_qna","inc_nt","inc_upa2","mixed_qna","mixed_nt","mixed_upa2","min2011","min_qna","min_nt","min_upa2","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","min","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15","min","others","l15_qna","min_qna","o_qna","l15_nt","min_nt","o_nt","l15_upa2","min_upa2","o_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiorenglish","loksabha","l15","nt","qna","na","inc_l15","inc_qna","inc_upa2","inc_nt","lib_l15","lib_qna","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_inc","lib2011","lib_inc_qna","l15_qna_2011","l15_nt_2011","inc_qna_2011","inc_nt_2011","other","n201102","l15_qna_201102","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_qna","l15_nt","min_qna","min_nt","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","l15","Y","Y","Y","Y","ExternalAffairs","awhetheralargenumberofIndianstudentsoftheTriValleyUniversityinCaliforniaUSAwereradiocollaredinhumanlytomonitortheirmovementsafterconfiscatingtheirpassportsbifsothedetailsthereofalongwiththebreakupofsuchstudentswithStatefromwhichtheyoriginatecwhethertheGovernmenthasraisedthismatterwithUSauthoritiesdifsotheoutcomethereofethemannerinwhichtheIndianGovernmentIndianEmbassyinUSAisassistingthemlegallyandotherwiseinUSAandfthemeasurestakenbytheGovernmenttoavoidrecurrenceofsuchincidentsinfuture","newdelhi",232

"i3229","t19100910250629","We shall know on September 15 who is to rule in South Africa
in the immediate future. Will it be General Botha or Mr. Merriman or
Dr. Jameson? In all probability, it will be General Botha. Every Indian
must have realized by now that General Botha is not likely to be won
over by flattery.

A fire is raging all round the Indians. In some parts of America,
a forest catches fire and that fire cannot be put out. Troops go out to
quench it, but even they find it a most difficult task. Hundreds of men
are burnt to death. Neighbouring villages are razed to the ground. A
similar fire is raging round the Indians in South Africa. But we have
not yet taken the warning. This shows our apathy and our selfishness.

In Cape Town, thanks to the efforts of Dr. Abdurahman and his
friends, Indian trading licences were not touched so far. But that has
now changed. The Town Council has refused to grant any licences in
certain areas. Mr. Alexander was the only one to oppose this. Mr.
Liebermann, who was once on our side, said that his eyes had opened
after the report of the Chamber of Commerce. Others, too, spoke to
the same effect, with the result that no licences were granted.

Though the Natal Act has been amended, a man like Mr. Goga
did not get a licence [for trading] on his own premises in Ladysmith.1
We find the same kind of high-handed treatment in Estcourt, too.2
About the Transvaal, the less said the better. There, those who
have submitted to the law continue to get licences, but this will not last
long. In what is described as the gold area, no licences are issued. Else
where, too, if they can, on some other ground, refuse a licence, they
certainly do so. Indian businessmen should note that after the Union
Parliament is formed, trading licences will come under heavy fire.

What are we doing, meanwhile? First, We must say with regret,
we waste our time in idleness or pleasure-seeking. Secondly, once our
own end is served, we show little concern for others. Thirdly, we are
vindictive and fight among ourselves. Fourthly, sometimes there are
quarrels between Hindus and Muslims on issues both small and big;
and when they are not fighting with each other, they as well as the
Muslims are busy quarrelling among themselves. Thus, everyone goes
his own way, unmindful of the others.

If there were no fire raging round us, perhaps we would not
have much to say against these selfish and otherwise unseemly ways—
no one, in any case, would listen to what we might say. A little
reflection will show to Indians that, if every person looked to his own
immediate interest, all of them would be in trouble before long. We
should not have to point out that the interests of the community
comprehend those of every individual Indian.

We believe they will lay hands first on the traders. Some Indians
may imagine that traders can escape harassment if they keep aloof
from other Indians. That this is mere short-sightedness is plain
enough. Right from the time that the movement against the Indians
started, the whites have had their eyes on their trade. It is the traders
alone whom they harass. True, some selfish whites, wishing us to chop
off our feet, do advise the traders that they will be saved if they
dissociate themselves from the others. Some say, again, that they will
have no difficulty to face, if they do not get involved in the affairs of
others. Everyone is told the same thing. Should we conclude from this
that there would be difficulties for no one? The truth of the matter is
that, if they can ruin us by soft words or baits, they would prefer to do
it that way. Failing that, they will adopt other means.

There is only one simple way in the face of this snare, and that is
to be alert and shake off our apathy, to get rid of our selfishness and
our internal quarrels, and to adopt all necessary measures.

As for the steps to be taken, making petitions, going to court, if
we have the money for that, fighting out in England, to the best of
ourability—all this may be good enough, but effective remedy there is
only one. Without satyagraha, everything will be unavailing.
Satyagraha means our own strength. In the absence of such strength
of our own, no strength of any other kind will enable us to hold our
ground for long.

I understand what you say. I only want to know what is possible
under the present circumstances. What should we do to bring about
the adoption of a monetary policy that would be in the interest of the
country? I leave aside the argument that we should go on doing our
best. Doing one’s  best  is not  enough  when  a  cloud  is actually
threatening. How much do you think the efforts of the people of
Quetta  must  have  availed  against  the  recent  earthquake   there?
According to me, a political earthquake is going on in the country just
now and we seem helpless against it. I am therefore taking care of the
future.
The names have been omitted.
I will not involve you in the problem of village industries. I give
you this assurance, however, that that programme will not interfere

I have received your two letters today. It would be honourable
and  proper  for you to be present wherever you are needed.
The cancer patient will have been attended to.
You have not given me Pyarelal’s address. Annapurna is being
given  rest. But she continues to have fever.
I have benefited from the change I have made in my diet. My
weight  has gone up by 1/2 1b. today. I am taking 5 tolas of butter and
4 oz. of roti. I take 8 oz. of milk only once in the morning. I shall
gradually make the change you have suggested. I shall try to take more
fruit. There are new faces around. Ram Saran Das and his daughter-in-
law are here.

"i6321","t19200331558039","First and foremost in the programme for the holy National
Week I put fasting and prayer. I have said enough to emphasize the
necessity of both these for the unfoldment of our national life.

I speak of these from personal experience. But, writing to a
friend on this very matter of prayer, I came across a beautiful thing

perchance I might convert them to a definite belief in the efficacy of
prayer. Here is the gem:
. . . More things are wrought by prayer
Than this world dreams of. Wherefore let they voice
Rise like a fountain for me night and day.

For what are men better than sheep or goats
That nourish a blind life within the brain,

If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer
Both for themselves and those who call them friend?

For so the whole round earth is every way
Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.

Throughout my wanderings in India, I have had the privilege of
mixing with men of all creeds, of mixing with thousands of women,
hundreds upon hundreds of students. I have discussed with them
national problems with a passion which I am unable to describe. I
have found that we have not yet reached a conscious recognition of
our national state. We have not had the discipline necessary for a
realization of that state and I venture to say that there is nothing so
powerful as fasting and prayer that would give us the requisite
discipline, spirit of self-sacrifice, humility and resoluteness of will
without which there can be no real progress. I hope therefore that
millions throughout India will open the Satyagraha Week with sincere
fasting and prayer.

I do not wish, during this weak, to emphasize the civil resistance
part of satyagraha. I would like us to contemplate truth and nonviolence,
and to appreciate their invincibility. Indeed, if all of us
regulate our lives by this eternal law of satya and ahimsa, there will be
no occasion for civil or other resistance. Civil resistance comes into
play when only a small body of men endeavour to follow truth in the
face of opposition. It is difficult to know what is truth, when to defend
it to the point of civil resistance and how to avoid error in the shape of
violence in one's pursuit after truth. There may well be differences of
opinion as to the advisability of preaching civil resistance as a creed
during a week devoted to national uplift, in which one seeks the cooperation
of all without distinction of party, class or creed.

Beyond the prayer and fasting on the 6th and the 13th we have
the collection for the Jallianwala Bagh Memorial.1 I trust that complete
organization would be set up in every province, in every district, and
every town or village.

The third part of the activity is represented by three meetings
during the week all over India at the stated times, whereat I have
suggested the passing of certain resolutions, viz., on the Rowlatt Act
which gave rise to the satyagraha movement, the Khilafat question
which by Hindu association cements Hindu-Muslim unity, and what
may be called the Jallianwala Bagh resolution, to be passed on the
13th April, calling upon the Government to take such measures as
may be necessary to prevent a repetition of the tragedies that were
witnessed during Martial Law regime and which were opened even
before the inauguration of Martial Law by the unlawful massacre of
the 13th. I suggest the following resolutions for acceptance:
1Vide “The 6th of April and the 13th”, 10-3-1920.

FOR THE 6TH APRIL
1. This meeting of the citizens of . . . hereby places on record
its emphatic opinion that there will be no peace in the land until the
Rowlatt Act is repealed and therefore appeals to the Government of
India to introduce at the earleist opportunity a bill repealing that Act.
FOR THE 9TH APRIL
2. This meeting of Hindus, Mohammedans and others, the
inhabitants of . . . , trusts that the Khilafat question will be solved
consistently with the just demands of the Mussulmans of India and
with the solemn pledges of His Majesty’s ministers and this meeting
records its opinion that in the event of adverse decision being arrived
at, it will be the duty of every Indian to withdraw co-operation from
the Government until the pledges are fulfilled and Mussulman
sentiment conciliated.
FOR THE 13TH APRIL
3. This meeting of the inhabitants of . . . is of opinion that whilst
mob excesses at Amritsar, although committed after grave
provocation, were worthy of condemnation, the deliberate and
calculated massacre, without warning, by General Dyer, of innocent,
unarmed and otherwise defenceless men to Jallianwala Bagh was an
unexampled act of barbarity and hopes that the Government of India
and the Imperial Government will take such steps as will render
impossible a repetition of such barbarity and other similar barbarities
committed by responsible officers in the Punjab during the period of
Martial Law administration and hopes that recommendations1 made
by the Punjab Sub-committee of the Indian National Congress will be
carried out in their entirety.
