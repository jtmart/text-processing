Prime Minister's Office


12–November–2014 18:33 IST 

Remarks by the PM at the 12th India–ASEAN Summit, Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar 

Your Excellency, President U Thein Sein, I am grateful to you for organising this Summit and chairing the 
session with great statesmanship. Under your leadership, Myanmar is playing an important role in the region and 
it has also benefited India–ASEAN relations. 

I am grateful to each of you for your views. They have further reinforced my confidence in the India–ASEAN 
Strategic Partnership. 

Above all, like good friends, you all wish to see a successful and prosperous India. 

I want to make a few points now. There are many similarities and convergences between us. India and ASEAN 
are second and third in terms of population. We are among the largest economies and among the three fastest 
growing economies in this century. Majority of us here belong to the developing world. 

We have the strength and the potential of a young population. In India, 800 million people below the age of 35 
years constitute a huge opportunity. 

We have embarked on a new economic journey in India. We are emphasizing infrastructure, manufacturing, 
trade, agriculture, skill development, urban renewal, smart cities. Make in India is a new mission. We are placing 
as much emphasis on ease of doing business in India as we are on making policies attractive. I invite you to this 
new environment in India. Indian companies are also keep to invest in and trade with ASEAN. 

I also assure you that there will be major improvement our trade policy and environment. We will also move 
ahead with connectivity projects with ASEAN with speed. 

I also suggest that we conduct a review of our free trade agreement on goods to improve it further and make it 
beneficial to all. . 
also urge that the FTA on Service and Investment be brought into force at the earliest. 

Many of you have spoken about the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. It can be a 
springboard for economic integration and prosperity in the region. However, we should aim for a balanced 
Agreement, which is beneficial to all; and, is truly comprehensive in nature, by equally ambitious agenda with 
similar timelines for goods and services. 

To deepen our connectivity, I am considering establishing, with your cooperation, a special facility or special 
purpose vehicle to facilitate project financing and quick implementation. 

However, in this age, more than physical connectivity, we need Information Highways or i–ways. My experience

is that even where road connectivity is poor, we can create vast economic opportunities and employment through 
i–ways. 

India is prepared to provide all assistance and cooperation in this area. 

ASEAN and India have large cities and are experiencing urbanization at a rapid pace. This is both a challenge 
and opportunity. Come and participate in building India's 100 smart cities and renewal of 500 cities. 

Science and technology and education are important areas of cooperation. 

We should think ambitiously of what we can do in Renewal Energy and Energy efficiency. Let us think of a 
major ASEAN India Solar Project for research, manufacturing and deployment. 

Space science can give us benefit in many sectors. We should quickly establish the new India–ASEAN Space–
related Ground Station in Vietnam and start the project for upgrading the existing station in Indonesia. 

As neighbours, India and ASEAN can gain a lot from cooperation in the disaster risk reduction, response and 
management. India is prepared to offer full assistance in capacity building, coordination and response in the 
region. 

We should further enhance our cooperation in health, including traditional medicine, climate change and 
environment and forests. 

Agriculture and food security is another area where I see great potential for cooperation, as some of you have 
mentioned. 

We should move quickly towards mutual Recognition of Degrees. We should conduct more research and 
exchanges on our ancient links and how our shared heritage can be of use to the modern world. 

Skill development is essential for creating employment opportunities for our youth and for our economic 
development. We should collaborate by sharing our respective areas expertise in skill development. 

I personally lay great emphasis on people–to–people contacts. I would like to see increased contacts between 
students, youth, teachers, parliamentarians, diplomats, media, farmers, artists and experts. 

Tourism has not grown the way it should. Today, of course, ASEAN region is the most popular destination for 
Indian tourists. I want to see further increase in ASEAN tourists in India. In this, the Buddhist circuit represents a 
vast opportunity. 

Excellencies, we pay a lot of attention to economic prosperity and protecting our environment. Do we pay the 
same attention to the security and safety of our youth?

We have received a high level of security cooperation from ASEAN countries for which I am grateful. 


But, we should further strengthen our cooperation on countering terrorism, extremism, drugs, arms, and money 
laundering. 

Excellencies, Asia's future is bright, but it also faces many challenges. Our progress and prosperity depends on 
peace and stability in the region. 

There is wave of change in the world. New realities are emerging in the changed world. Globalisation is a fact of 
life. We are all affected by it and we have all benefited from it. 

And, in this world, maritime trade and passage, and therefore, maritime security has become even more 
important. We all have the responsibility that we all follow international law and norms on maritime issues, as 
we do in the realm of air passage. In future, we will also need this in space. 

For peace and stability in South China Sea, everyone should follow international norms and law. This includes 
the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We also hope that you will be able to successfully 
implement the Guidelines to the 2002 Declaration on Conduct and that the Code of Conduct on South China Sea 
can be concluded soon on the basis of consensus. 

Finally, I would like to say that it is a great privilege to meet all of you here. This has doubled my confidence and 
enthusiasm about our relations with ASEAN. 

I assure you of my sustained personal attention to relations with ASEAN so that we can meet our high 
expectations from this relationship.

"i63217","t20150228146030","It's a pro poor and a pro growth budget. The entire road map from Jan
Dhan to public welfare has been well defined to fulfill the expectations
of the common man.

On one hand we wish to make the states more capable and on the other hand
are the tasks of fulfilling national priorities and important
requirements. The emphasis is to provide special support to the SC, ST,
OBC, Dalit, the marginalized and the exploited.

There was a lot of publicity around the MGNREGA, but for the very first
time, for the poor to be able to earn their daily bread, maximum
disbursement has been made to ensure that the poor finds employment.

The small time businessmen of our country – those who sell on carts,
vegetable vendors, the hawkers who sell clothes, these people has problem
getting finances. The banks would not be forthcoming with loans; they
would not get the money. We have presented a separate scheme called
“Mudra” so that these people may easily get loans at the time they
want, for the amount they want. In the coming days it is going to be of
great help to such people.

In this budget, we have presented our point of view and our commitment to
get back black money in front of the entire nation. Now the people with
black money will not be spared. Now nothing but jail is their destiny. We
are bringing in a new law. Today we have presented an extensive plan to
ensure strict action against those having black money. At the same time
we would like to see that no more black money is created further. Hence
we are bringing in a new law against the Benaami or the unnamed
transactions.

Budget should be such that it increases investment. It should help make
our economic potential stronger. All the plans in this budget will
enhance investment. They will promote infrastructure and fulfill the
dreams of a common man. I can say that this budget will ensure maximum
employment generation.

In this budget, many schemes for the common man have been introduced. Be
it accidental insurance, life insurance, pension schemes or the easily
available education loan for youngsters, for their college expenses. We
have ensured seamless arrangements of the same.

And most importantly, my farmer brethren, especially my poor brothers and
sisters who are worried about their old age, the poorest of the poor in
the country, the farm labourers and the farmers, when in old age they are
no longer able to work, they should be receiving pension. We have
envisioned such a scheme for them. For the first time, every citizen will
be able to benefit something from the pension scheme. We have undertaken
this huge task in this budget. We are moving ahead with our motto of
development of all.

I would like to congratulate my friend, the Finance Minister Sri Arun
Jaitley for giving us a budget that is pro poor, has initiatives for
growth, development, jobs and which inspires the common man to achieve
new heights with renewed zeal and enthusiasm.

I have immense faith that this budget will give us opportunities to scale
new heights in the coming days.

"i78956","t20190402192373","Long live Mother India

Popular Chief Minister of Bihar, our friend Mr. Nitish Kumar ji, sitting on the dais, Mr. Ram Vilas ji, my colleague of Council of Ministers at the Center, Brother Mr. Sushil ji, Deputy Chief Minister of the State, Dr. Prem Kumar ji, Minister in the Government, all senior dignitaries and huge number sitting on the dais. My dear brothers and sisters of Gaya have attended.

Your blessings have been motivating me to work continuously for five years. Panchadhara of development means education for children, earning for the young, medicine for the elderly, irrigation for the farmer and hearing of the people. For this, if we have been able to make a sincere effort together with all the partners of NDA, then all of you have your support and participation. Today, whatever progress is being made in the country, the changes that have taken place, the needs of common human beings have been fulfilled. This has happened only and only because of the cooperation of all of you and therefore, with folded hands, I thank all of you, thank you because you have given us the opportunity to serve you for five years.

Brothers and sisters, are you happy with whatever this watchman has done for you? The rest of the work that will be done will also be completed by this watchman. Do you believe it? This belief of Gaya ji, Aurangabad and the whole of Bihar will press the button on the new attitude of New India on April 11 and once again Modi government will form.

Friends, all of you, the whole country, even our Indian brothers and sisters living abroad, are blessing all the watchmen. There are only two types of people in the country and the world who have problems with the watchman. Do you know who these people are, who are these people who are upset with the watchman? These two people are troubled by the watchman and their advocates and the other terrorists and their helpers, the same people. It is also very important to know why they are upset.

Brothers and sisters, here in Bodh Gaya, where people from all over the world come to know and understand Lord Buddha's path of peace and non-violence, feel peace. What happened at such a place on 7 July 2013, how Bihar was shaken by bomb blasts at different places. Before 2014, there were bomb blasts in many cities, in cities across the country. There were bomb blasts or not? Sometimes in Hyderabad, sometimes in Ahmedabad, sometimes in Delhi, sometimes in Ayodhya, sometimes in Kashi, sometimes in Jammu, there were bomb blasts or not? Were innocent people killed or not killed? Some Indian Mujahideen, some Huji, such organizations were engaged in creating an atmosphere of fearless fear. What happened that after May 2014, the Mujahideen, Huji all collapsed, where did that sleeper cell go? The police, the intelligence agencies the same, the information systems the same, their strength the same, their skills the same, so what changed, what changed? Who shut down the blasts, who silenced the blasts? Modi did not, one of your votes has done, the strength of your vote. In five years, India has seen how big your vote serves India.

Brothers and sisters, by troubling the army of this country, we can do good to the country, protect us? Can our lives be easy? But these people are saying these things. These are such people that these people should tell whether they trust the sons of India or trust the sons of Pakistan? Friends, the whole world stands in favor of India today. Everyone stands with Hindustan on everything, but these great nobles talk exactly as Pakistan does. These political parties in India seem less Pakistan spokespersons. Do Jamui, Nawada and Munger want the heroes of India or the Pakistanis? Will punish Pakistan's parties? Will punish Pakistan's parties? Friends, The NDA government of the Center and Bihar are taking India towards strength today. Whether it is terrorism or Naxalism, our policy is clear. Whoever does the work of showing India the eye will not be dealt with softly. There should be no doubt about it. Whether it is people giving ideological fodder to the Naxalites or people giving shelter to them. Friends, if any youngsters go astray, we have done everything possible to bring them into the mainstream. In the last five years of UPA, Naxalites surrendered as many youth influenced by Maoist ideology. Two and a half times more youth have returned to the mainstream in the last five years, leaving the path during our government.

Friends, if something has changed then the customs changed, the policy changed, the intention changed. The Chowkidar government was formed in Delhi, this is the change and the result is in front of you. In our police, there was no shortage in our security agencies before, there was lack of political independence. Our security personnel used to capture the terrorists, the sleeper cells, and these great people left such dangerous people to vote only for appeasement. This thinking, the same policy, strengthened the roots of terror in India and the lives of thousands of innocent people lost their politics.

Friends, they did not stop here, they created a bogey, Hindu terrorism, for the investigation not to be right. His think-tank, the Congress nominee, was engaged in holding Hindu terrorism responsible for terrorism in India. He did the same in the Samjhauta Express train and did not take the investigation on what the role of Pakistanis was. They have fought such a battle against terror and today when the watchman is busy crushing terror with full vigor, then he is abusing the watchman only.

Brothers and sisters, very careful to all of youKnowing, only those who can find the caste, creed of terrorists for power, they can never fight against terrorism and Naxalism. Friends, this is the same community that gives ideological and logistic support to the Naxalites, they are the same people. It should be that use your mind to bring the wandering youth into the main stream, apply your power, but these people are busy instigating such youth. This watchman is fully committed to crush this mentality that promotes bloodshed in the country.

Brothers and sisters, they are hated by the chowkidar of the Great Wall, the tea-seller, the sweeper, the sweeper, and everyone who works. He has a lot of problems with how one gets ahead by working on his own. This is the reason that various types of abuses are being given to the watchman. The Congress leader even went so far as to say, this Modi watchman is nothing but a watchman, it is only a watchman of toilets. During the recent Kumbh, the country has seen the abuses inflicted on me by the cleaners, our dear brothers and sisters, when I washed my feet and thanked them for the cleanliness. You tell me, those who guard the toilets, do cleanliness, is it not an insult to them, this insult is acceptable to you? Do you approve the insult of working people in society? Do you approve of the joke of the poor? Is this not the discrimination of the mentality of Congress leaders? The state of powerful workers like Dashrath Manjhi, Bihar will definitely teach such people a lesson.

Friends, the NDA government has been working with respect for everyone, along with everyone's development. We are the people who salute the work of every caste, their contribution. This is what Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar arranged in our Constitution. Be it the work of giving the poor, the deprived, the exploited homes their pucca houses, the work of giving free treatment up to five lakh rupees a year, the work of providing free gas connections from house to house, providing electricity to every household, Whether it is the work of connecting every poor's home with a toilet or opening the bank account of every poor, our government has made a meaningful effort to get the poor out of the cycle of poverty.

Brothers and sisters, there was a time when half of Bihar's villages lived in darkness. I congratulate Nitish ji, accessing electricity in every house is not a small task. I too have been the Chief Minister of a progressive state, but it is not a small thing to get such a siddhi, I congratulate Nitish ji and his entire team.

Brothers and sisters, Gaya ji, Aurangabad, Bihar, our government of NDA has come to the right path today after many days of hard work from the days of old chaos. Gaya ji and Aurangabad were one of the 112 districts behind the country's development order. Our government, with the participation of all of you, launched a campaign to advance these backward districts, the result of which is that today both Gaya ji and Aurangabad districts have become the top five among the fastest growing aspirational districts of the country. . Today, those who were 112 in the whole country have come inside the five, Nitish ji congratulations to you, congratulations, also congratulations to those government officials. Getting from 112 to five is not a small job, brothers. Those who work, know how closely you have to work, all these officers, small and small people of these two districts, accept my greetings, accept the greetings, you have done a great job. Friends, NDA is making sincere efforts to bring life in the life of Bihar, which was made by the great women. You know more than me how terrible the water problems have been in this entire area, including Gaya ji. What did these people do with the North Koyal project, despite so much problem, the Congress talked about making the project in 1972, spoke and then fell asleep. He slept for 47 years and my farmers here wept. We are completing the irrigation project, along with crores of farmers of Bihar are also depositing money in the bank account thrice every year. The first installment has come in the account of many farmers and those who are left are also going to reach their account very soon.

Brothers and sisters, when all our MPs from Bihar and Jharkhand brought this matter to me, I was shocked. I immediately asked the officials to solve the problems related to this and now work is going on at a fast pace. You can imagine, the country is spending about two and a half thousand crores on the dam that should have been built at a cost of thirty crores. Friends, the way the work would have been done in Bihar at the time of the earlier governments, if the NDA government had not been formed in time, Gaya ji would not have known how many Dashrath Manjhi had to build.

Friends, Bodh Gaya ji has both faith and spirituality. In 2015 there was a very spectacular International Budhist Conclave. In which I had the opportunity to be present myself. The NDA government is constantly making efforts to make this city the foundation of our development along with our faith. All the necessary arrangements are being made for this, the NDA government is developing Gaya ji as a spiritual pilgrimage i.e. from where more and more people come to realize the spiritual, those people have least difficulty. The expansion of Gaya Ji Airport here is also going on fast. Gaya ji to Kushinagar is connected by air. Heart and heartFacilities in tourist destinations are being strengthened here through Rasad scheme. To develop smart facilities in Gaya ji, investment is being made on roads, streets, sewer systems, traffic lighting, everything. Vehicles will run by CNG and cheap piped gas will also be delivered to homes. Apart from this, many new trains have been started and several lines are being electrified, including the Gaya-Kiul line.

Friends, any city associated with tourism progresses when worked together on many levels. From the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to improving the power supply, the tourism center has the advantage. The benefits of connectivity, digital India campaign, modern infrastructure, are directly linked to the tourism sector. Due to these efforts of the government, there has been an unprecedented change in this area in the last five years. The tourism sector of the country is also benefiting from giving e-visas to 165 countries. Friends, before the arrival of NDA government, India used to have 60-65 lakh foreign tourists a year, now the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also crossed one crore.

Brothers and sisters, when these foreign tourists come, they also spend a lot of money. Due to this tourism, India earns about one and a half times more than what it used to earn in 2013. This extra money, this increased income is also going to cities like tourism, in cities like Gaya ji. Whether they are people selling handicrafts or people who shop for other things, all of them set up shop in the tourism sector itself. Therefore, more tourist means, local people earn more, when the earnings from foreign tourists increase, the hotelier also earns and the tea seller also earns.

Brothers and sisters, be it work related to development or challenges of the country, strong government is needed for that. A strong government with terror, poverty, discrimination, corruption, a strong government with good intentions can only deal with it. I am confident that this time all of you will break the record of last time and put every seat of Bihar in NDA's account. Will you pour it, sure? Will go from house to house, explain to voters, I express my gratitude to you all with this confidence.

"i56517","t20120506282861","My heartfelt greetings to all the people gathered here! Today, Gujarat has got the opportunity to show respect on the land of Surat to all those people, who have contributed towards enhancing the glory of India as Biharis. I welcome all these good sons of Bihar on this land of Gujarat. I show my respect to them. They have contributed towards the development of India in their own ways. Hence, I congratulate them.

Bihar is celebrating its centennial right now. In 1912, when there was the British government, Bihar separated from the Bengal and began its journey of development. Friends, in the past for some time Bihar fell into the hands of such leaders, that its contributions were written off the minds of the people because of the destruction caused. But please don't forget that Bihar has given a lot to this country for centuries. The entire humanity is grateful to Bihar for its contribution of the Buddha. You can go anywhere in the whole of Asia today. They are influenced by the Buddha. Being influenced by the Buddha means being influenced by Bihar. In every corner of the world, Bihar made its identity through the Buddha in that period.

Gujarat has had a very close relationship with Bihar. Even today, both Buddha and Mahavir have their influence in Gujarat. Even today, Gujarat is living under the influence of Mahavir. Even today Gujarat is making an attempt to live as Mahavir. And I am amongst those fortunate people, who were born in that city, where Huein Tsang from China had come. Eight hundred years ago he had come and stayed in my town of Vadnagar. And Huein Tsang has written in his historical writings that in that period, there was an institute for the training of 10,000 Buddhist monks in my city. There was an arrangement for the residence of 10,000 monks there. This shows how much the influence of the Buddha had spread at that time. And I am proud to have been born in that city, so that our link gets established with history. Friends, in the whole world, if you can see the remains of the Lord Buddha in your hands, it is so only in Gujarat. Even recently, when excavations were being made, we found the remains of the Lord Buddha in a golden casket and taking these, we are going to build a beautiful memorial for the Lord Buddhaon the land of Gujarat. Even today, if you go to Girnar, you'll find that the Rock Edicts of Ashoka are extant there.

Brothers and sisters, when Mahatma Gandhi had started his first movement, he began it on the land of Bihar in Champaran. And when Jayaprakash Narayan Ji started the first movement against corruption, he did it on the land of Gujarat. A son of Gujarat begins his movement in Bihar and a son of Bihar comes and leads the youth in Gujarat. Bihar and Gujarat have had this relationship.

Brothers and sisters, you have come from Bihar to earn your living. You are welcome on the land of Gujarat. Whatever Gujarat is today, it has the fragrance of the sweat of India. Gujarat has not been built with only the sweat of Gujaratis. People from every corner of India have shed their sweat here and that's how my Gujarat has been built. Hence, everyone is welcome as well as respected in Gujarat. Brothers and sisters, Manoj Tiwari has the same right on Gujarat as Narendra Modi has and all of you also have the same right on Gujarat.

This country is one. It cannot be divided in pieces. It has a unified tradition, a unified culture, a unified heritage and a unified populace. Because of this unity, there is no corner of India, from where people have not come to live in Surat. Brothers and sisters, if a son of Bihar has gone to any other corner of India, his mother must be asking, “Son, are you fine?” But if he has come to Gujarat, his mother sleeps peacefully, thinking that her dear son is safe in Gujarat. If a single daughter leaves Patna and reaches the boundary of Gujarat in her train, her mother asks how far the train has reached. When she knows that train has entered into the territory of Gujarat, she says, “Daughter, you have now reached safely; I can sleep now.” Gujarat has built this reputation for itself.

Brothers and sisters, in this centennial year, if we all can carry out one task, we should do it. And it is worth doing. And Narendra Modi will do this work. But what work is that? For some reasons whatever is spoken about Bihar, those are not nice words. This should stop. Friends, after so many years, you will see that many people who have made achievements are from Bihar. A large number of IAS officers are from Bihar. A large number of IPS officers are from Bihar. A large number of members of Team India are from Bihar. A large number of people in the film industry are from Bihar. In the field of education and Sciences, a large number of people are from Bihar. There was a son from Bihar here. Son, please stand up for a while. In the whole world, this son of my Bihar has crossed the heights of knowledge. Then why do people talk about this Bihar in any kind of words they want?

Let's all pledge that we will re–establish the prestige of Bihar and will say that you have everything. They are nice people, who are hard working. But its image has been tarnished. Friends, if there is an attempt to tarnish the image of any state, problems arise for centuries. Once again, we have to show the prestige of Bihar. It has everything; we don't have to give anything. Only we have to speak on its behalf. Wherever we go, we should say it's a good place. Brothers and sisters, if we begin to speak in favour of Bihar, its lost self–confidence will come back again. And I have the confidence that if there is a state that can give direction to the country, that can show the way, then such a state is Bihar. Brothers and sisters, because of this, we are celebrating this centennial with great fervor.

And I appeal to the Bihari community in Surat that they should not stop at just this programme in Surat. Biharis are not only in Surat. There are more than fifty towns where Biharis are living in Gujarat. And everywhere we should have some centennial programme. You have full support of my government for this. Last year we had celebrated the Golden anniversary of Gujarat. We had celebrated it in Patna as well. We had celebrated it also in Ranchi. We had also celebrated it in Dhanbad. In this Golden year anniversary all these people had joined hands together. If Bihar celebrates the Golden anniversary of my Gujarat, then Gujarat will also celebrate the centennial of Bihar with great fervor.

It is my good fortune that I got the opportunity to show my respect to such senior people. The organisers of this programme of Bihar invited me for this programme and gave me this opportunity. I am grateful to them. Brothers and sisters come and let's go forward with the mantra of development. We have only one mantra i. e., development. I want Gujarat to develop so much that your house in Bihar will be filled up with the money earned here. Your mother should be happy that her son has gone to the right place, from where he sends so much of money. With the development of Gujarat, Bihar should prosper. We all should make this effort. With this wish, I welcome you all. Jai Bihar! Say it loudly, Jai Bihar! Jai Jai Bihar!","pms","modi","2012","201205","20120506","gujaratcm","prefirstterm","upa2","statepol","speech","other","other","other","india","gujarat","surat","otherstate","hindiother","biharcentennialsession","httpwwwnarendramodiinnarendramodiattendsbiharcentennialsessionsurat2724","nmo2012","3874","3874","notrans","collective","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","modi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","nmo_spe","na","yes","others","m","bjp","nmo_st","nmo_upa2","bjp_spe","bjp_st","bjp_upa2","m_spe","m_st","m_upa2","pms2012","pms_spe","pms_st","pms_upa2","nmo_pa","nmo_reg","nmo_gc","nmo_pa_spe","nmo_reg_spe","nmo_gc_spe","nmo_pa_st","nmo_reg_st","nmo_gc_st","nmo_pa","nmo_reg","nmo_gc","nmo_pa_spe","nmo_reg_spe","nmo_gc_spe","nmo_pa_st","nmo_reg_st","nmo_gc_st","nmo_pa","nmo_reg","nmo_gc","nmo_pa_spe","nmo_reg_spe","nmo_gc_spe","nmo_pa_st","nmo_reg_st","nmo_gc_st","nmo_pa","nmo_reg","nmo_gc","nmo_pa_spe","nmo_reg_spe","nmo_gc_spe","nmo_pa_st","nmo_reg_st","nmo_gc_st","modi_spe","modi_spe","modi_spe","modi_st","modi_st","modi_st","modi_upa2","modi_upa2","modi_upa2","nmo","nmo","nmo","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_st","nmo_st","nmo_st","nmo_upa2","nmo_upa2","nmo_upa2","mint","clean","lib","hindiother","pms","nmo","st","spe","p","bjp_nmo","bjp_spe","bjp_upa2","bjp_st","lib_nmo","lib_spe","lib_upa2","lib_st","lib_bjp","lib2012","lib_bjp_spe","nmo_spe_2012","nmo_st_2012","bjp_spe_2012","bjp_st_2012","other","o201205","nmo_spe_201205","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_st","pms_spe","pms_st","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","Ms","Ms","Ms","Ms",NA,NA,NA,1322
"i64953","t20150827282783","My colleague Shri J. P. Nadda, Minister of Health and Family Welfare,
Govt. of India, Shri. Kesetebirhan Admasu, Minister of Health, Govt. of
Ethiopia, Hon'ble Ministers from participating countries,
representatives of Development Partners, friends from the civil society,
the private sector, media, academia, national and international speakers
and esteemed delegates. On behalf of my Government and all the co–hosts
for this international summit, I warmly welcome you to the Global Call to
Action Summit 2015.

This is a landmark occasion, as for the first time, the Global Call to
Action Summit is being held outside USA. My Government is honoured to
host this Summit. All those delegates who have travelled a long distance
to attend this Summit – I heartily welcome you to India and to New
Delhi. I am delighted to be with you this morning.

This two–day Summit, celebrating the achievements of the participating
countries in the area of Maternal and Child Health, was conceptualized to
accelerate joint leadership for ending preventable deaths among mothers
and children. It will showcase the power of new partnerships, innovations
and systems to bring about improvements in life–saving interventions. I
firmly believe that this Summit will provide a highly effective platform
to address common challenges that will help us achieve the desired goals.

How we shape the world in the next 15 years will make the difference
between prosperous, optimistic nations, and insecurity and unrest. I am
glad to see 24 nations present here to join together in their commitment
to end preventable maternal and child death. This is a “Call to
Action” to all of us to seize this opportunity and think big.

Today, as we gather here to discuss strategies and as we transit from the
Millennium Development Goals to Sustainable Development Goals, let us
acknowledge the sad reality that the world continues to lose about 289
thousand mothers and 6. 3 million under–5 children every year. The 24
priority countries participating in the Summit contribute nearly 70percent of
the preventable maternal and child deaths. For India, with its birth
cohort of 26 million, the challenges are formidable but the commitment to
succeed is also as strong. What, however, does offer hope is that most of
these deaths can be prevented through simple yet effective and proven
interventions. This forms the key peg for this Summit. This also formed a
crucial part of the joint statement issued subsequent to the visit of the
US President in January this year, where we agreed to further accelerate
the joint leadership to end all preventable maternal and child deaths.

Keeping aside the work that still needs to be done, there have been
significant achievements on the global front in the area of maternal and
child health. Looking at the big picture, we find that in 1990, India's
under–five mortality rate stood at 126 while the global average was 90.
In 2013, this figure dropped to 49 against a global average of 46.
Therefore, the gap to the global average reduced from 36 points in 1990,
to just 3 points in 2013 reflecting that India has achieved under–five
mortality rate decline at an accelerated pace compared to global rate of
decline. What this translates into is this: India is likely to reach
close to achieving the MDG target if the current trend of annual decline
is sustained.

In addition to this remarkable achievement, another truly historic
accomplishment has been the victory over Polio. India was declared as
“Polio–Free” on 27 March 2014. From being a country which accounted
for more than half of the global polio cases in 2009, to being declared
free of the wild polio virus: the journey reflects India's deep
commitment to child health.

I am also happy to share with you today another major milestone achieved
by India. India has eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus. The
validation for this has happened much before the global target date of
December 2015. This gives us the confidence to achieve other targets well
before the target date.

To sustain the efforts of being a Polio–free and maternal and neonatal
tetanus free nation, and to accelerate the full immunization coverage in
the country, my Government has added to the world's largest
immunization drive another mission known as “Mission Indradhanush”.
It focusses on vaccinating the left–outs. It also targets to accelerate
the current increase in annual rate of immunization from existing 1percent to
more than 5percent per year. This will help us achieve more than 90percent coverage
by 2020, which otherwise would take more than 25 years at the current
pace. The first phase has been successfully implemented. We want to
ensure that no child in India dies of a vaccine–preventable disease.

India has always partnered with the global efforts on issues of child and
maternal health. India is the first country to respond to the global
commitment to reduce newborn mortality, subsequent to the launch of
Global Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) at the World Health Assembly in
June 2014. India launched the India Newborn Action Plan (INAP) in
September 2014, targeting reduction in Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) and
still births to single digit by 2030. India also responded by acting on
the first “Call to Action” through its commitment and launch of
RMNCH+A.

These remarkable successes in the field of maternal and child health have
been possible through our National Health Mission (NHM). The Mission,
with its urban and rural health components – perhaps one of the largest
public health programmes in the world – has resulted in improved health
outcomes. 52percent of India's under–5 mortality is contributed to by deaths
of newborns in the first month of life. Under the NHM, our approach
emphasises a continuum of newborn care both at the community and facility
level.

Our focus has been to get pregnant women to have safe delivery in our
institutions. We launched an ambitious program – Janani Suraksha Yojana
(JSY) – wherein incentives were given for delivering in public
institutions to the beneficiaries directly. As a result, today, more than
75percent of the deliveries take place in our institutions. This has directly
contributed to reduction in maternal mortality. We are fully aware that
out–of–pocket expenses remain a key barrier for women to access timely
health care and services. To overcome this, we have launched a programme
called Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) under which every woman
delivering in a public health institution as well as the newborn is
entitled to free and cashless health services, with an assured provision
of free drugs, diagnostics and diet besides free to and fro transport.
This has helped to further improve our institutional deliveries.

Not only are the mothers provided focused health services, but individual
beneficiary tracking is being done through the countrywide Maternal and
Child Health Tracking System, which ensures close tracking of inputs and
outputs at the level of service provision. More than 92 million mothers
and 78 million children have already been registered so far in the system.

One of our major concerns is equity. As a step towards ensuring equitable
health services across regions that suffer from intra–state disparities,
and to bring about sharper improvements in health outcomes, a total of
184 poorest performing districts all over the country have been
identified. Special efforts are being made to put in more resources and
focussed programmes in these areas.

One of the flagship programmes of my Government is the 'Swacch Bharat
Abhiyaan' (The Clean India Campaign) . As a part of this large
campaign, the Health Ministry has launched the Kayakalp scheme to
encourage public health facilities to maintain high standards of hygiene
and sanitation, as I firmly believe that clean and hygienic environment
is the stepping stone to a healthy nation. To save and educate the girl
child we have launched an ambitious program – Beti bachao Beti padhao.
We need to ensure that the girl child survives, thrives and plays a very
crucial role in society.

I have witnessed people getting poorer because of unfortunate health
episodes. We need to institutionalise a system where marginalised
communities receive universal health care and financial protection. We
must experiment and learn from each other. India stands ready to boost
its commitment and partner with other countries and move forward on our
promise to end maternal and child deaths and provide a better life to the
adolescent. I invite you, to commit to bold measures and hold each other
accountable to these promises.

As we assemble here, we need to send a very very strong message not only
to ourselves, not only to the 24 countries present here, but to the
entire world. The message is of our commitment, that we will ensure that
every woman, every child who can be saved will be saved. We also need to
make a clarion call to the world to join hands in taking such steps that
would ensure this. India stands committed to not only allocate resources
towards this in our country, but also to help the world and all those
countries which needed any support. It is my personal vision and my
Government's firm commitment.

While every country present here has something to offer, India also has a
wealth of experience. India has done well in many ways and would be
extremely happy to share its experience with other countries. Last year,
I had made a commitment of assisting the SAARC countries in keeping it
Polio free. We have also made a commitment to provide Pentavalent
vaccines to such SAARC countries as would need it. We will offer whatever
experience we have to the world community.

India would be happy to assist any country with technology, system
strengthening and programme implementation capsules. We could train
personnel and skill them for better management of child sickness in our
Special Newborn Care Units (SNCUs) as well as share our experience at
home based new born care. India's rich experience in Universal
immunization and particularly its experience this year with the Mission
Indradhanush could be shared with all the countries. We had offered this
to SAARC countries earlier. Today I repeat this offer to all countries
present here. This will be apart from our offer of support for Polio
eradication.

I again warmly welcome you all to this important international Summit. I
hope the next two days would provide a new direction to the global
community in its journey towards ending maternal and child deaths.

I wish you a pleasant stay in New Delhi.

Thank you very much. Jai Hind!

"i65784","t20151119494803","All dignitaries and my dear friends.

If any live mechanism does not adapt to changes coming with time, it
ceases to be effective. It becomes rigid. Any redundant arrangement
becomes a burden on the system. It is therefore , necessary that like the
development needs, there is a need to develop or mould the mechanism
accordingly. It is also necessary to make certain changes in the
mechanism as per need of the time. It requires courage to get rid of any
traditional mechanism. If we use a new mechanism and observe its efficacy
minutely, we may gradually change our mindset and adapt our mechanism as
per the changed circumstances.

Two types of people are present here. One, who are full of energy and the
other , who are ready to leave after finishing their training. They are
anxious about their future course of action when they will leave in 2016
or 2017. You people would be thinking that what will be your priorities
when you get your posting and how will you function to achieve your
objective. So, this actually is an opportunity for both these groups of
officers.

When you moved out from Mussoorie, you must have had a sky high
confidence and a feeling of having everything in your control. But what
was the state of your mind when you were told that you were not supposed
to go right then and that you would have to stay for some more days there
itself ? Only time will tell as to what is in store for you. In our
childhood, we use to listen that (people carve the stones) and if anyone
ask them what they were doing, their answers were always from each other.
Someone used to say, “Bhai what can we do, we have taken birth in a
poor family, so, we earn our livelihood this way”, Other used to say,
“ See, earlier I was working some where else but there was not
sufficient income so I came here and now trying to change my destiny by
curbing the stones. Third one replied, “we have got the job, so we are
doing and learning”. When we used to go to other one, who was working
with lot of enthusiasm and happiness, he used to reply, “No, it is not
a curse, it is a matter of pride by God's grace, I have got the
opportunity to construct a beautiful and gorgeous temple and I am
contributing my best efforts in decorating this temple”. He had replied
this way as he was associated with the last and ultimate goal of making
the temple and this perception always made him courageous and encourages
him to work tirelessly. He never treated his work as a burden.

Sometimes, we too go to the farmers' agricultural fields. If some
farmer comes to us with a problem, we try to resolve it. At this
juncture, we feel that we have done some or the other work of a farmer.
If we go to a village where there is a problem of electricity and succeed
in solving the problem, then we feel that we have found a solution of the
problem. Whenever, you will proceed from here after passing three months
in this situation, you will feel that the days which you have passed in
Delhi, the work you have done for changing the scenario and picture of
India then you will feel that you have contributed for the benefit of the
land where you live. There is a lot of difference between efforts made by
a person coming from Mussorrie, the satisfaction what he gets and in the
perception of the picture of India's future and making efforts for
doing work in any particular region. Really there is a lot of difference.
By these experiences you have gained in a period of three months, I am
confident that your perception to work will definitely change.

If you go in such a region where two villages do not have electricity,
where even there is no pole of electricity, then will you feel good? Yes,
here are approximately 18,000 villages in India, where there is no
electricity and after knowing this fact, you will surely feel that
electricity must reach at least in these two villages. You would think of
taking up the challenge as a mission. This spirit of attachment cannot be
learnt through books, lectures or academic discussions; it can only be
acquired by attempting various means and wages to accomplish the job.
Now, this experiment is quite new but gradually it is developing. You
would have been briefed about some job initially. Then, later on, some
other responsibilities were also entrusted to be done on priority basis.
None of the responsibilities can be avoided and a new approach has to be
developed in order to accomplish each job properly.

I would like to request all of you that we should do this experiment of
three months or we think about its duration and to think how changes can
take place and how it can be made better and better. At the same time, we
have to decide, what has to be done, whether to do it or not. If we do
this, how it will be beneficial for us etc. This is the first batch which
could get opportunity to be associated this way. If you give such type of
suggestions to the department, which they are putting before me and
telling me that they are regularly interacting with you, they used to ask
your experiences as well as share their experiences. But if you really
feel to make this arrangement more result oriented, quite livelier then
you will have to give suggestions to make this better and better.

Now you are going to get a new responsibility. Perhaps two types of
things may come to your mind. One, there shall be curiosity– 'Yes! very
good. we are going for the first time'. We were never involved in the
Govt machinery. How would be that new platform? Secondly, it will
definitely come in your mind, 'you have to prove your skills, do
something for betterment”. This dilemma will definitely come in your
mind. Isn't it? This is the weakness of each and every individual that
what work he or she has been assigned, there shall be an ardent desire to
do it successfully. But, the problem arises where one thinks that only he
can do everything. Most of the people may face some or the other problems
during the beginning of their career. He is not aware that he is at the
age group of 22–30 years. But, the people seating there is of the age
group of 35–40. He is sitting there for more than the year of your age.

You feel that you have come here as a big IAS officer, but he is of the
opinion that more than 15 have come and gone during my tenure. This
begins with ego clash. You have come with some or the other dreams and he
is passing his life traditionally. Clash begins between your dreams and
his tradition and time comes when clash reaches to the climax and becomes
a struggle. In this situation, time gradually passes or you do one or two
things as per your convenience and if you feel that you have done
something, each and everybody sitting here would have experienced defect.
If you talk to them, you will come to know that there is a need to go
there and work as each of us do not have more than 10 years time in our
life to do something. It is supposed that there are not more than 10
years. Whatever new things you do, what new things you learn, what
experiments you do, they will remain with you only up to 10 years. What
remains are files, nothing else. These 10 years are not merely that
tenure. This is the time to connect ourselves with life not with file.
The person who maximum utilizes this tenure of 10 years, his foundation
will become such strong that he will be contributing a lot more in 22–25
years.

If anyone is not associated with society or does not understand ground
realities and with the passage of time if he comes in the pipeline, he
has to reach the station, but there shall be such point of time, where he
will find himself a burden. Then you will feel that noting can be done
with this officer, who has 20 years experience. In this situation, your
will feel that post him in some or the other department, leave it at the
destiny of the department itself etc. If we have come after doing our
work honestly, we have learnt the basics of our work, if we are committed
to it, you will find your strength, you will able to understand the
situation and ways and means to handle it. Why because you have done
yourself at the grass root level. Sometimes this experience becomes a big
strength.

One of our Chief Ministers told me about an incident, about himself. He
told me that he was an ordinary person in the beginning of his career. He
was working in Police Department in a very small capacity. But his
overall personality was very much impressive and as a result he became
the Chief Minister. When he was Chief Minister, a severed incident took
place. Son of a big politician was kidnapped. There was a big tension in
the state because the politician was of the opposition party. The Chief
Minister was of a third party. Media was taking advantage of this
situation. You will not believe that the Chief Minister mobilized the
huge machinery. He has given information, which was very interesting. He
told his intelligence department to meet milk sellers to visit those
areas where the demand of milk has increased randomly; He ordered them to
find out the families who are taking two letter milks instead of 500
grams. He identified that there were some families who were taking more
milk randomly. He ordered them to monitory such family and surprisingly
the kidnappers were residing in those areas where the demand of milk was
increased. He has utilized his experience gained working in the police
department after becoming Chief Minister. He thought about what no one
could even guess and the kidnappers had been arrested and the son of the
politician was rescued. Everyone took a breath of silence and piece. How
could this happen is a live example of once experienced gained during the
early period of his career.

In your life you are in such stage, where you have to make a lot of
efforts, you have to do your best so that your colleagues and fellow
companion may think that the officer himself is working hard. If you lead
from the front and contribute your best, you will never have to say you
colleagues to do work. They will automatically follow you. If you put a
signboard that each and everyone has to come office in time, it will not
be proved worth if you yourself does not come office 5 minutes before the
scheduled time. If you set an example before your colleague, it will
become strength. If you order your officers to visit once in a week, to
stay in a village for a night or for two days, it will not be fruitful
until you yourself do not go there and stay at night. What arrangements
our forefathers would have mad, they had not been futile, this should be
our supposition. Some of the other logic would have been behind them.
Some of the other reasons would be behind them. Basic logics have their
own strength. Can we follow them religiously? We can follow them
religiously but applying our intellect to find out the realistic outcome.
If we are doing this way, we will feel the results are coming. Now you
people are in such stage where you are going to handle one fifth
districts of India in coming ten years. In next ten years, you people can
change the destiny of these one fifth districts of India! If this team
changes one fifth districts, I do not believe that there is nay hurdle to
change the whole of India. You have mechanism, you have right to take
decision, you have team and resources.......... what no? You have
everything.

Secondly, we have to focus on the least struggle. I can not say that no
struggle can take place anywhere. Some of them may happen somewhere. But
efforts towards team formation, knowing experiences of our elders can be
fruitful. In which district you have been posted, may be some of them
would have been working there itself in the beginning of the career. In
this situation, you have to find out how many officers have been working
there since last 25 years. Get in touch with them, write them letters try
to get their contact nos. and ask them how it could happen. You will know
the history of last 25 years and the Journey ahead will become quite
smoother. You will be connected with a community and there shall be a lot
of people in the community.

Human life is itself a big quality. We have to take advantage of this
quality. Any officer while retires from the service and comes in the
category of the pensioners, he becomes an idol of intellect and
experience. He has the knowledge of his practical life. He can get lot of
suggestions and advice – He will say 'Do this', 'Do that', it
will be beneficial; it will not be beneficial etc. I am not of the
opinion that they were wrong. They could not do in their time but they
know very well that it would have been done. There would have been some
or the other reasons due to which they had not done. If anything happens
through you, retired and experienced person wants you to get it done.
Hence, there is a lot of knowledge and experience available to us. If you
are working in a particular region where 8–10 officers have already
worked during last 20–22 years, you have to take time from them or try to
talk to them or request them to guide you. You can simply ask them that
you are going there so please share your experience with me as you have
been working there for many years. He will tell you about those who are
co operative who can help you in time of need, may be they have become
quite old, but they will help you. This way you will get a qualitative
heritage, which you can not find in the files. This comes only after
experience. There shall be no one who can carry you to those people. You
will have to make efforts yourselves. We should make efforts to add
something in this mission. We should be of the opinion that the strength
of the society is more than that of the Government. The Government has to
make lot of efforts to execute the work, which can easily be carried out
if the society comes together. Natural calamity is a common phenomenon in
our country. Suppose, we have to provide food packet in Govt. offices,
what management we do, budget expand, whether 2000,5000 and so on, but if
we take help from the society and request them emotionally, the whole
process will become smoother. Such a large number of people will come to
help us in times of natural calamity. This is the power of society. The
gap between society and the Government can not be filled by politician
alone. For this very purpose, we will have to change our nature. It is
not necessary that we should be associated with the society through
electric body alone. There should be such a mechanism where we can
directly communicate with our society. Second lacuna is that the approach
through a established mechanism, which is not more fruitful because they
are established and their jurisdiction is fixed. We should make direct
communication with the citizen and you will see that after some time you
strength will increase. You will get help from all corners of the society
beyond your imagination.

They are doing everything for you. If you have any work associated with
education, you will approach through your Govt. Officers or you will
discuss the issue with teachers? You will see the change. I mean to say
that you can come out of your office and associate yourself with the
society at large. Which plan was prepared by our experienced officers and
the suggestions given by you are before us. Now Mr. Sinha has to see and
discuss about it and try to find out the loopholes which have been
demonstrated in your presentation. Apply the experience you gain in these
circumstances and given suggestions. I would like the people from the
department should seriously think about it at a proper forum and try to
find out what can be done? May be the outcomes are not satisfactory or
any firm decision could not be taken but I am confident that this process
will give some or the other solutions and it will be definitely a good
one.

This is the process which you have to apply in a place of posting. You
have to approach absolutely fresher's, who have experience of 05 years
or 07 years and tell them 1 or 2 major problems of the area. If you feel
that you have to stay 2–2 ½ years in that area and want to address these
two major problems call them and say to come after study. Why we are not
communicating the problems? What efforts we should do, how improvement
can be made, such suggestions may be invited. You will see that they have
become the part of your team. What study will take 6 months that they can
do within a week? There should be enough flexibility in How can we make
separate layers of our team, how can we expand them. If you maintain this
flexibility in your administration, you can change at large. Today, I
will talk about your responsibilities. I will tell you so and so are the
plans of Govt. of India and you are supposed to implement. This is the
nature of Govt. Officers that any paper coming from the top becomes the
Bible for him. But sometimes it is the responsibility of the
administration to encourage him and to make him feel his responsibility.
If we talk about it, you can give us better result.

Sometimes, people become sick, we came to know that now a day viral is
going on. People are falling sick due to viral, but at the same time we
see that there are some people who are not falling sick. They are not
sick because of their immunity, their inherent strength due to which
viral is not affecting that. Wherever we go we can find out the viral of
laziness, ignorance and corruption. If I go there with such strength, no
viral will exist there. If the viral spreads, it can be cured by a single
tablet. A lively human being can change the scenario even if the viral
exists there. If a tablet can change the situation, we are human being,
why can we not? No result can be achieved by simply pretending ourselves
indulged in work.

But scenario can not be changed by tension and struggle. Your strength
will increase, if you associate people in the process of governance. How
powerful your experiences are, you can not achieve that much result which
you can achieve by associating people. That is why always keep in mind
that in which area you are going, what responsibility you are going to
take, sometimes such opportunities come in life which can make you reach
in such heights, which you cannot imagine. Today I feel that India should
not loose this golden opportunity at world level. It has no right to
loose it. Nor, Hundred and twenty five crores Indians as well as we
people associated with the mechanism have any right to loose these golden
opportunities. Such opportunities rarely come at global environment,
which I feel. The opportunity which has come, should be utilized. It is
the course of discussion, how we can utilise these opportunities to reach
India in new heights. How can we take advantage of these situations? For
this we will have to fulfill our responsibility with our full strength
wherever we are. We will decide to go ahead. See, the Country will
proceed.

My best wishes to all of you and thanks a lot.

"i65466","t20151019232837","All the dignitaries present here. I congratulate IDFC Bank for its
journey of 18 years. It may not be very long but in this small journey of
18 years IDFC Bank has marked its place onthe map of India. So for, they
marked their presence with rock, mortar, stone, wires, lime etc.
Theybuilt roads, buildings and ports but now they are moving in the
direction of life building. And I believe you now face more challenges as
compared to past 18 years. Because that was a limited clientele, and; you
knew about the project; the revenue; refund; bank position etc. This is
not the same area. The work of anengineer is simple but that of a teacher
is very complicated. The teacher has to nurture a life,where as an
engineer has to build a building. Whatever work was done by IDFC till
now; they need to play the role of a teacher also. And I feel in spite of
the challenges it would be a step in right direction.

The basic objectives of the bank is to reach villages. I feel it
unfortunate for the country to formulate a rule that unless you open 25percent
branches in villages you won't get permission. I feel there should not
have been the needfor sucha rule but it prevailed. Because we never
understood the potential of our village life. In urban life, government,
government machinery there is enough opportunity to run suchbusiness and
running a bank, continuing its growth was not much of a challenge, hence
noattention was paid to it. But, in recent past it has come to mind and
everyone has noticed that rural life in India has alsobecome a major
growth centre. You must be knowing, when telecom industry came and were
given spectrum; whenever one talked about villages they felt shaky. They
used to give sub–contracts and run their business. But when they went to
villages, it was a surprise for them to know that percentage of telecom
growth of rural area was more than that of urban area. The spread and the
speed was also faster. And in this sense it was good for them. The
communication of villagers is generally with other cities and hence the
income level was also better. I think that banking sector is also going
to experience the same. Rural economy is giving a major boost to Indian
life. AMajor change is taking place.

One more thing, as Arunjiexplained in detail that now the banking system
has changed. Now mobile banking is going to rule. Banks are going to be
Premises–less, and Paper–less. There would be no premises and no paper.
Even then the banks would run; people would get money; people would do
business. And slowly, a situation in our country would come when the
expenditure of printing currency would also get reduced gradually we have
to take the country forwardin that direction. And as we do banking with
the help of technology, arrange for paper–less bank and run currency less
business, the possibility of generatingblack money would gradually become
zero. The use of this whole systemis to be made in a framework that shall
address major concerns of the country. IDFC is doing a beginning in this
direction. It is commencing from Madhya Pradesh that too form aremote and
tribal arealinked to the Narmada belt.

From an economic point of view, the whole world todayis looking towards
India,not only with hope, but with satisfaction. It feels that whenthe
whole world isin turmoil only India has been stable. In global economy,
handling of stable economyby a nationalso plays a vital role of balancing
inthe world. And India has played that role at the time of this
entireglobal crisis. India could make its position feltamidst such a big
turmoiland therefore a possibility to go further up is also immense.

The worlds estimate about India isthat its huge potential remains
untapped. People do not question how would you progress or how would
yousurvive. This is not the point of discussion. The discussion is that
despite so much of opportunity why are you lagging behind? This is the
question being asked. The whole world feels that in the economic senseif
there is any potential area of growth that is India. And we have seen,
that be it in the World Bank, IMF or any other rating agency they all
have said that India is among the fastest growing economies of the World.
If this is our strength, it is our duty to strengthen the foundation and
also grow vertical. We will have to grow both vertically and
horizontally. To go horizontal we will have to think of entering
intotherural life? How do we increase our business? How to select new
areas? If we look at priority sector, giving money to priority sector is
Government's rule. But if we have to lend money to agriculture
sector,and give it to a fertilizer factory, Which also comes under
agriculture sector, it is not fair. We need to come out of it. We need to
keep in mind a common agriculturist or a village and think of the ways to
create a cold storage among 2 4 or 10 villages, make arrangements for
warehousing, and do banking. We should think of helpin value addition. If
we only talk of agriculture sector, there are immense possibilities.
Indian farmer is trying to align with the world. You might have noticed
that a lady was telling her mobile number in English. It is not
necessarythat she learnt it in a school. These things are gradually
becoming a part of society and life. To understand this strength is
necessary, because it has brought the change.

I had described once, when I was Chief Minister in Gujarat, there isa
very backward tehsil near Dharmpur in Balsad District. It is a tribal
belt. As a Chief Minister I had never been there, so I requestedfor a
visit. I said, If there is no programme, I will go plant a tree and come
back. Then a programmefor inaugurating achilling centreinauguration was
fixed. Now what is a chilling centre, does not cost 50 lakhs, it is a
small thing. The people who come at the collection centre, their milk is
kept there by the time trucks come to collect it. I said I would go for
that. There was no space for the programme, as it was in a forest. There
was one school around 2 to 2. 5 kilometers away. The function was
organized there. For this programme, they invited around 50 tribal women
at the chilling centre. There was a different environment all together. I
was surprised that when the inauguration of chilling centre took
place,women were taking photos with their mobile phones. I went there and
asked what would you do with these photos? Their reply was all the more
surprising. They said, we will get it 'downloaded'. Now, this
'download' word was known to them. Also, how and where this
'download' takes place was known to them. Now, let us think how can
we make this a part of our growth story and work in that direction.

Similarly, about our youths…. Why should there not be a system of
getting easy bank loansfor their studies? Women self–help groups get
money. If they have to deposit Rs. 100 on Wednesday they come on Tuesday
itself and say – sir please deposit my money else it may get spent. Such
is the sensitivity; in our rural lives. We have not replied the desired
benefits of itMoney–lenders established their grip on this and have
damaged our economy a lot. So we have to create a confidence, a
guarantee. I understand our effort shall definitely bear fruits.

It has been our effort in banking sector as well. When banks were
nationalized. It was said that it has been done for the poor but we have
seen that it's effecthas been very limited. As the medium class family
have a family doctor, the high class families have a banker. If the
banker has organized lunch or dinner somewhere, such people will join it
even ifthey are unwell because they know how important it is to run their
business. This may be good or bad but it exists. I understand that
whether you name it Neo–middle class or middle class, it is a great
strength. How to develop such systems focusing on them? Let's say you
have two proposals. One is to construct a building, or a government
office and the other to establish a college or a higher secondary school
by an individualwho needs money from the bank. If I am in the bank, I
would accord first priority to the school proposal. Because, I know if a
school comes up, it has the power to create 50 offices automatically.
Therefore, what should be our investment priority? What should be
priority of lending money? If we create a chain that gives us multiple
benefits we would be greatly benefited.

Now, the financial inclusion mission that we have undertaken… Like Arun
Ji was telling about the PradhanmantriYojna in which we provide finance
under mudra yojna to middle class, poor, washer man, barber, milkman,
newspaper vendor etc. In this country around 6 crore people are involved
in such jobs and their average loan is 17000 rupees. It is not much but
they take this money from money lenders, pay interest and could not
prosper. Under mudra yojna our attempt is tofree such people from
thisrigorous circle and provideliberalfinancial helpto them. We have made
provisionfrom 50 thousand, to lakh rupee loan. I think it is hardly 100
days since launch of this scheme. We have around 61 lakh clients and
about 35 thousand crore rupees have been disbursed till now. Infusion of
35 thousand crore rupees in the market means it has given a great
strength to the economy. There is not much change is 35 thousand crore
rupees areenforced in a city by infusing the same money in thousands of
villages, creates a vibrancy in economy changes will become visible.

In our country, several questions have been raised about banking sector
ranging from appointments to governance and lending money. We held a
round table conference with bankers and discussed in detail. What are
their problems,expectations from the Government, and legal issues?
Everything was discussed in details. These were representatives of RBI.
Arun Jiand I were also there. The matter was discussed threadbare and
whatever points came out of it we have tried to implement. We have put
together a seven point scheme. I understand that such things are hardly
discussed in our country. But the decision is very big and A, B, C, D, E,
and F this is my seven point programme. This seven point programme is
going to bring a major change in the life of Banks.

Our A is for – Appointments. We have decided to bring reforms in
appointment on higher posts in banks and hence after 1969 private sector
people here also been brought to nationalized banks. Otherwise, people of
nationalized banksused to move to private banks. This reverse trend has
started for the first time which in we have stressed upon efficiency.

B for – Bank, Board and Bureau. We have brought this B3 for the first
time in the country selection for all the top ranks would be done by this
board. Politically, I may like somebody and make him a director later
while sanctioning the loan the proposal comes through him only and when
he is known as Pm's man, loan is bound to be sanctioned. This has been
the main reason behind bed debts hence, we won't do this;and will put
all professional to this work.

C for – Capitalization. There are bad loans out of those given during
past few years. These have resulted in a crisis as nothing will be served
by repenting, have made a plan to invest 70 thousand crore rupees in
banks to bring them out of this crisis created due to bad loan.

D for – De–stress of assets. In some areas having problems, we have
decided to increase import duties to support domestic producers. We did
it recently in steel to strengthen steel industry. So we have taken many
other steps to–words de–stress. There are 6 new debt recovery tribunals
engaged in recovery of bad loans. We are taking fast decisions related to
power sector,this is facing the problem of NPA.

E for – Empower. What I mean by empower, I said in the meeting at Pune,
is zero interferences. You won't ever receive a call from political
leadership and establishment about what is to be done for a particular
loan. Now even after many months there has not been news of any pressure.
Run the system on purely professional basis and bring it out of the mess.
We have worked towards empowerment of banks in this manner

F for – Framework for accountability. We have set key performance
indicatorsto monitor the performance of banks to regularly know the
direction we are heading.

And the last is G for – Governance. We have to stress upon governance
in our banking sector. We need to bring in technology and transparency.
Chances of cyber crime and data theft are maximum in the banking sector
and financial world. These are the two major sectors w where we need to
ensure our governance. This is the seven point programmer to empower the
banking sector.

Government has taken many important initiatives. I believe that in coming
daysbanking sector will move along with the country and with same fast
pace.. In some areas, bank may be two steps ahead and I hope that this
would ultimately help achieve the decided goals for India

My best wishes to IDFC for its future May itprogress a lot in this field.
Many many thanks.

N. Chandrasekaran ji, Rupa ji, Ladies and gentlemen who carry this legacy of theirs !!

Ratan Tata ji, meeting Chandrasekaran ji, discussing with him always gives a new experience. They have the responsibility of giving leadership to one of the largest institutions in the country.

Despite such a huge responsibility, Smile and Stress Free, how they live, I think, in the coming time, Chandrasekharan should write a book on this too. And yes, I do not have any patent for this Idea. You can do this without any stress !!!

Colleagues,

I cannot say whether he will write the book or not, but what happens with Smile and Stress free Mind,

The result is in front of us as Bridgital Nation.

Positivity, Creativity and Constructive Mindset can lead to thinking of solutions to the problems of the country, this is the result.

This positivity, this optimism, this belief in its talent and resources is the thinking of the new India.

I believe that this book will not only inspire Aspirational India, but will also encourage some professional Pessimists of the society for a new approach and new Outlook. I congratulate Chandrasekharan ji and Rupa ji for this visionary document.

This book has come at a time when a huge effort is being made to demonize technology. An attempt is being made to create an atmosphere of fear.

Particularly, in India, Context is trying to present technology as a challenge to our Demographic Dividend.

In this book, the vision of the government is further strengthened, according to which technology works to add, not to break.

Technology is a bridge connecting everyone with development.

Colleagues,

This sentiment has been there in our last five years and this is our approach to the future.

This book describes how modern technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Robotics are going to help as Aid as a tool of development.

I can say the same thing based on my experiences. You can feel how Technological interventions have reformed and transformed governance in India in the last 5 years. I will give you an example of how all this is happening.

Peers

The scheme to provide LPG gas connection in our country, subsidy work has been going on for decades.

When we launched the Ujjwala scheme, many people thought that maybe it will be the same plan as it has become, but for this we changed the thinking, changed the approach and also introduced technology in it.

Colleagues,

If we went on as before, then the committee would be formed, the committee would sit, talk to different stake holders and we could never meet the deadline. But instead of the committee, we relied on technology approach.

With the help of Data Intelligence, we first located 17 thousand existing LPG distribution centers and then prepared 10 thousand new centers in a very short time. For this we digitally mapped every village in the country.

Based on the analysis of about 64 lakh divers data points from millions of villages, it was decided that where these distribution centers should be built. But our work did not end here. There was another big problem, which was solved by technology.

During the real time monitoring of applications and distribution on the dashboard, it was found that many women are getting rejected applications. Because they did not have a bank account.

To tackle this problem, Jan Dhan Camps were organized and bank accounts of such women were opened.

As a result, the target we had given 8 crore connections in 3 years was fulfilled long before the deadline.

Peers

It was a matter of increasing access to technology. Now let me give you an example of how technology plays a role in bringing behavioral change from Access. Your book on the state of healthcare has been highlighted in the country. In particular, the mental block of not receiving treatment, which has been due to poverty in our country, has been due to lack of money.

Ayushman Bharat Yojana is playing a big role towards changing this situation. The poor who had previously shied away from getting treatment in the worry that everything will be sold, have started reaching the hospital. He was also hesitant to knock on the door, he got access there.

Today, the situation is that there has been a behavioral change among the poor, demand for medical services has also increased, the poor are also being treated and hospitals are also getting money from the government. If this is possible then only technology Through this.

Peers

With this technology, we are developing Ayushman India as a complete package of healthcare.

Earlier there was no focus on Preventive Healthcare, Primary Healthcare was limited to just headaches and stomachaches and Tertiary Healthcare was on a completely different track.

Now for this, one and a half lakh health and wellness centers are being prepared in the country and they are being developed as a base of Tertiary Healthcare.

In a very short time, more than 21 thousand such centers have also been prepared.

You will be surprised that in such a short time, over one and a half crore people have hyper-tension at these centers, more than one and a quarter crore diabetics, one and a half croresMore cancer cases have been diagnosed.

Earlier this was not possible in primary healthcare centers. Now these cases are being referred further from Health and Wellness Centers. And based on the data there in the Tertiary Healthcare Network, there is a beginning of possible direct and rapid treatment.

Colleagues,

We also get the solution for Transparency and Targeted Delivery when technology is built. You are well aware of the role of middlemen and brokers in India.

It was accepted as a rule. This was because there was a gap between the people and the process. From birth to death, there was a long system of Certification, in which the normal human was crushed.

Today hundreds of government services ranging from birth to life certificates are online. Today Self Certification is becoming the norm in the country. Now we are moving towards systems like Self Assessment, Self Declaration and Faceless Tax Assessment.

Colleagues,

Another example of how the effective use of technology transforms Challenges into Opportunities is India Post Payment Bank, India's largest network, our Post Office service was in danger of being shut down due to the increasing proliferation of mobile and internet, millions of people There was a crisis on employment.

But today due to technology, post offices, banking services and digital delivery home delivery centers are being built.

Similarly, common service center network providing online service delivery in villages is providing employment to more than 12 lakh youth.

Colleagues,

I also broadly agree with the suggestions given in the book to strengthen the Entreprise spirit, to strengthen MSMEs and to make them important centers of Job Creation. Are using

You know about the Government e-Market place ie GeM for Public Procurement. It is a bridge between the government's demand and MSME's Supply Eco-system.

The success of this system can be gauged from the fact that there is a target of purchasing 50 thousand crore rupees through it this year.

Peers

Similarly, Start Up India is bridging local demand and supply, while Make in India, local supply and global demand.

In this book you have explained very closely the problems in demand and supply. Start Up India is also dealing with the same problems.

This is an attempt to transform the ideas into industry by incubating the challenges that India faces, which is why more start-ups are getting ready in Tier-2, Tier-3 cities today.

Colleagues,

Amidst all these things, it is also right that, technology is not the only solution, Human Intention and Right Intention are very important. The same thing also applies to Artificial Intelligence. It should not be debated what is the danger from Artificial Intelligence? How long will a robot be smart to humans?

Rather it should be debated that, how do we build a bridge between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intentions? How to Upgrade Your Skills to New Demand?

There is a lot to say but I have to give other people time to read the book. Once again, many congratulations and best wishes for this great book, best effort.","pms","modi","2019","201910","20191020","pmo","secondterm","nda3","nationalpol","speech","other","other","other","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hindiother","technologyisthebridgetoachievesabkasaathsabkavikaspm","httpswwwnarendramodiintextofpmsaddressduringthereleaseofbookbridgitalnation21oct2019","nmo2019","207","5588","gt","saksham","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","modi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","nmo_spe","na","yes","others","m","bjp","nmo_nt","nmo_nda3","bjp_spe","bjp_nt","bjp_nda3","m_spe","m_nt","m_nda3","pms2019","pms_spe","pms_nt","pms_nda3","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p2_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_p2_nt","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p2_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_p2_nt","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p2_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_p2_nt","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p2_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_p2_nt","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nda3","nmo_nda3","nmo_nda3","nmo","nmo","nmo","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nda3","nmo_nda3","nmo_nda3","mint","clean","lib","hindiother","pmsgt","nmo","nt","spe","s","bjp_nmo","bjp_spe","bjp_nda3","bjp_nt","lib_nmo","lib_spe","lib_nda3","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2019","lib_bjp_spe","nmo_spe_2019","nmo_nt_2019","bjp_spe_2019","bjp_nt_2019","other","o201910","nmo_spe_201910","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_nt","pms_spe","pms_nt","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","Ms","Ms","Ms","Ms",NA,NA,NA,1404
"i83567","t20200617237140","Greetings to you all!!

This is our first meeting after Unlock-One. Yesterday, I have discussed in detail about the experiences of Unlock-One in 21 states and Union Territories of the country. In reality, the spread of Coronavirus is higher in some of the big states and cities. In some cities, overcrowding, small houses, lack of physical distancing in the streets and movement of thousands of people everyday have made the fight against Corona pandemic more challenging.

Yet, due to the discipline of every citizen in the country, the preparedness of the administration and the dedication of our Corona warriors, we have not let the situation go out of control. Due to timely tracing, treatment and reporting, the number of people recovering from the virus is continuously rising. It is a matter of great relief that only a very few patients are in need of ICU and ventilator care.

Due to the correct steps taken on time, we have all been able to combat this great danger. The discipline shown by the people of the country during the lockdown has prevented the exponential growth of the virus. Today we are in a much more stable position in terms of treatment, health infrastructure and trained manpower.

You are also aware that just three months ago, there was an outcry for PPEs and diagnostic kits not only inIndia but also in several countries of the world. There was a limited stock in India too, as we were completely dependent on imports. But today more than 1 crore PPEs and the same number of N95 masks have been provided to different states. We have sufficient stock of Diagnostic Kits and their production capacity has also been greatly increased. Now the supply of ventilators made in India under the PM-Cares fund has also begun.

Today, there are more than 900 testing labs for Coronavirus across the country, lakhs of Covid special beds, thousands of quarantine and isolation centres, and adequate oxygen supplies to facilitate patients. Lakhs of human resource have been trained during the lockdown. And most importantly, today every citizen of the country has become much aware about this virus than before. All this has been possible only because of the local administration working day in and day out, in collaboration with the state governments.

Friends,

Amid these reassuring factors of our victory in the fight against Coronavirus pandemic, we must continue to emphasize on health infrastructure, information systems, emotional support and public participation in a similar manner.

Friends,

Considering the increasing number of patients of Coronavirusour topmost priorityshould be expanding health infrastructure and saving every life. This will only happen when every Coronavirus patient gets proper treatment. For this, we have to place more emphasis on testing, so that we can trace, track and isolate the infected person as soon as possible. We also have to keep in mind that our existing testing capacity is fully utilized and is constantly upgraded and expanded.

Friends,

A large number of quarantine and isolation centres have been set up during the last two-three months. We have to increase its speed so that patients do not face shortage of beds anywhere. The importance of Telemedicine has also grown amidst the Corona pandemic. We have to increase our efforts to ensure that everyone, be it the people in home quarantine or isolation, or those suffering from other diseases, get the benefit of Telemedicine.

Friends,

You are well aware of the fact that the right information at the right time is very crucial in dealing with any pandemic. So we also have to see to it that our help lines are helpful and not helpless. Just as our medical and paramedical staffs are fighting a battle against Corona in the hospitals, we need to create large teams of senior doctors who can guide the sick through Telemedicine, providing them with the right information. Besides, we also have to raise an army of young Volunteers who can run the helpline effectively for the public.

The states with high downloads of AarogyaSetu App have shown very positive results. We have to constantly try to increase the reach of the AarogyaSetu App so that more and more people can download it. We also have to keep in mind that now the monsoon is gradually advancing in the country. It is very important to deal with the health problems that come up with this season. Otherwise this too can become a major challenge.

Friends,

There is also an emotional aspect of the fight against Corona. We also have to find ways by which we can pull our citizens out of the stigma born out of the fear of the virus. We have to assure our people that the number of people who have defeated Coronavirus is very high and it is increasing rapidly. Therefore, if someone contracts Coronavirus, he/she must not panic.

It should be our priority to provide essential services and ensure the required facilities to our Corona warriors, such as our doctors and other healthcare workers. It is the responsibility of all of us, the entire nation, to look after them at every level.

Friends,

In the fight against Corona pandemic we have to constantly motivate people from civil society and every other field of the society. They have played a commendable role in this entire fight. We have to repeatedly remind people about mask or face-cover, physical distancing and sanitization process in our public places and offices. We should not allow anyone to be careless in this matter.

Friends,

Many states are doing yeoman service in the fight against Corona pandemic. It is important to share the good practices of these states. I believe that every state will place here their experiences and suggestions with open mind. It will help us in forming a better strategy in the coming days. I would now request the Home Minister to take the discussions forward.

"i65285","t20150927379659","Good Evening California,



Good Evening California,

Your excitement is overwhelming. It is 27th September here today and in
India it is the 28th of September. 28th September is the birth
anniversary of the brave son of India, Shaheed Bhagat Singh. I salute the
brave son of mother India, brave Shaheed Bhagat Singh ji. I will start
with 'Veer Bhagat Singh' and you all must follow up with 'Long
live! Long live!' with both hands raised up.

Veer Bhagat Singh… (Long live! Long live!)

Veer Bhagat Singh… (Long live! Long live!)

Veer Bhagat Singh… (Long live! Long live!)

I have been here for past couple of days. I have had the opportunity to
meet many people. Last year in September, I had come here for the UN
summit. On 28th September last year, I had the opportunity to meet my
countrymen at Madison square. Today, in California, after a year, I have
the opportunity to meet you all.  I have come here almost after 25
years.  Many things seems to have changed. I can see many new faces. In
a way, I am experiencing a vibrant image of India in California.
Whosoever I have met here has a shine on his face, dreams in his eyes and
I see people here with the determination to do something. And one of the
most important aspects is that the citizens of this country feel very
proud of the Indian community here and respect them. I congratulate all
of you for this accomplishment and compliment you all.

India has created a new identity and a new image, in the entire world
today. The world has been compelled to change its old viewpoint about
India. The reason behind this is the magic of your fingers. You have
created a new identity of India by movement of your fingers on the
keyboard. Your capabilities, commitment, innovations are compelling the
world to change. The one who refuses to change or has decided not to
change with time will become irrelevant in the 21st century.

You can imagine how much it makes me happy to see youth from India like
you transforming the world by working in a foreign land. This is why I
congratulate and welcome you for the efforts and the initiatives for
making India proud, adding to its prestige and compelling the world to
look at India in a new light.

At some point or the other in our country we used to hear things and
there used to be discussion as well that “do something, this
brain–drain should stop.”  I say, mother India is a land of many gems.
It will keep cultivating intelligent brains one after another. Had
anyone thought that this brain–drain could turn into brain gain? This is
why I see this phenomenon from a different perspective. There was a time
when it seemed like brain–drain, now I feel this is brain–deposit. This
deposit of brain is now looking for opportunities. The day this brain
gets that opportunity it will repay its motherland with interest by
serving it. Will it or won't it? (Yes!)

Will it or won't?... (Yes!)

Will it or won't?... (Yes!)

Are you sure?... (Yes!)

This is why, it is not brain drain but it is brain–deposit. It is an
invaluable deposit. My countrymen, I say now is the time, the
opportunity, wherein every Indian should make people aware of their
power, take advantage of one's knowledge. The land, the water, the air
and the values which has helped us reach where we are today is awaiting
us. We seem to be connected and bound together with West coast,
California because of IT, our youth, and our democratic values.

However, if we look through the window of history of the 19th century, my
Sikh brothers from India came here, started farming and built a
connection. The fight for India's independence was going on, on the
Indian soil, the desire for independence was in India but who can forget
the rebellion that was going on here, thousands miles away, where the
torch of independence was lit. For India to be independent, our Sikh
brothers and sisters, our Indian brothers, who were settled here in the
west coast, California used to make every effort possible and this is the
connection.  If in the 19th century, a farmer who was settled here was
worried for India's independence then the 21st century youth is worried
about the poverty in India and that youth will also do something for
India. Is there a bigger inspiration than this?

In 1914, Gopal Mukherjee became the first Indian graduate from Stanford
University. Not only this, in 1957–63, Dileep Singh Sood became the
congressman from here, was elected an M. P and was the first Indian to be
seated in Washington and describe about us. Very few people know about
Jai Prakash Narayan who sacrificed his youth, who lived his life on the
values of Mahatma Gandhi and who headed a movement against the second
attack on democracy after independence, when emergency was imposed in
India, when respectable leaders were jailed in 1975. Many of you must be
unaware that Loknayak Jai Prakash Narayan came here to study in
California. This means that the Indian connection with this area has been
very integral and firm.

Today, in order to create a new world, the Indian community is sitting
here and building a prospective history. This is why every Indian feels
proud when they think about you and I am very glad to see you all here
today.

It has been almost 16 months since I got elected and came to power in
Delhi. I was a stranger when I came 16 months back. I did not even know
the geography of the place properly.  I needed somebody's help to know
the way to the parliament. A new person like me had been given a
responsibility by the 125 crore people of India. I have been trying to
fulfill that responsibility with your blessings. Wherever in the world
you go today, people are looking at India with hope and confidence. Since
last 20–25 years, a discussion has been going on – '21st century
belongs to which country? Everyone admits that they think it belongs to
Asia. Everyone agrees to this. But from some time now, people are not
saying that 21st century is Asia's century, in fact, people are saying
that 21st century is India's century. The world has started believing
this now.

Why has there been a change now? How have things changed?  (People
shouting, Modi Modi)

This change is not due to Modi, Modi, Modi alone. This change has been
possible due to the power of determination of 125 crore Indian citizens.
These 125 crore people have decided and they are determined that now
India will not lag behind. When the majority of people are determined
about something then even the Gods shower their blessings. The whole
world that used to see India as a nation holding a marginal position, now
sees it positioned centrally. There was a time when India used to
struggle endlessly to keep up with the rest of the world. Everyone had
tried in their own ways but today the times have changed in a way that
the whole world is yearning to connect with India. This environment of
trust that has developed is going to take India to new heights.

I said this when I came to power, and I am going to say this again today
that because of the technology that you have developed nothing can be
hidden today. Nothing can stay far and no news can wait. As soon as
something happens, you get the news on your mobile phones. This is what
you have done and this is why you are updated about even the smallest
news in India. Sometimes, when you sit in a stadium to watch a cricket
match, you have to keep turning your head everywhere to keep track of the
ball, to know the position of the fielder, to know what wicket keeper is
doing and also to track the umpire. But when you watch a match on the
television, sitting at home, you can see everything, you know where the
ball is, what the fielder is doing, where the wicket keeper is and where
the umpire is? Do you or don't you? That is why, you, who look at India
from far away land, see it better than the people who look at India while
living in India. You know everything that goes on there, what Modi is
doing, what Modi used to say earlier, what has Modi done – you know
everything.

When I came to power, I said that I will not leave any stone unturned in
terms of working hard. I will work endlessly and will dedicate every
moment towards fulfilling the responsibility that 125 crore people have
entrusted me. Today, after 16 months, I require your certificate.

Have I kept my promise? … (Yes!)

Have I kept my promise? … (Yes!)

Have I kept my promise? … (Yes!)

Have I worked tirelessly? … (Yes!)

Am I working day in and day out? … (Yes!)

For my country? … (Yes!)

The responsibility that you have given me and the promise that I made, I
am complying on it fully. In our country politicians are blamed very
easily. He made 50 crores,  she made 100 crores, the son made 250
crores, the daughter made 500 crores, the son–in–law made 1000 crores,
one paternal cousin bagged the contract, maternal cousin got flats.

You get to hear all this or not?... (Yes!)

Are you fed up listening to all this or not?... (Yes!)

The country has become hopeless, yes or no?... (Yes!)

People are now sick of corruption or not?... (Yes!)

Are people angry or not?... (Yes!)

My fellow countrymen, I am standing amongst you all today, is there any
taint on me?... (No!)

Is there any taint?... (No!)

I want to assure my country that we will live and die for our country.

(Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Bharat Mata Ki Jai!)

Dear brothers and sisters,

Our country is powerful and competent. Sometimes people ask me, Modi ji,
where do you get all this confidence from? Why do you think your country
will progress? People of my country ask me, they say Modi ji, “this
happened, that happened, are you not worried, are you not afraid? You
keep saying that our country will progress?” I believe that my country
will progress. I believe in it because my country is young. What can a
country not achieve when 65percent of its population is younger than 35 years?
The country that has 800 million youngsters, 1600 million arms, what can
that nation not accomplish? Dear brothers and sisters, I can say with
firm belief that this country will not be left behind.

Do you know about the terminology that was introduced in the world a few
years back? About the countries that are going to pick up a faster pace
of development. What are the chances? A term was coined then,
'BRICS'. B,R,I,C,S and the people who coined this word said that
there are these five countries  – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South
Africa that will develop very fast and lead the world. These five
countries were point of discussion. If you have observed it closely,
there were murmurs that this “BRICS' terminology needs to be changed
because we were thinking that 'I' would progress but 'I' is
tumbling down and this discussion had started. In BRICS 'I' of India
was perceived to be less capable of playing its role. People could not
understand how the BRICS theory will work without the 'I'.

Dear countrymen, today, I can say it with immense pride that in the word
BRICS, if there is any letter that is standing strong, it is the letter
'I'. Within 15 months, we have reached the heights of development,
attained economic stability, initiated various development programs and
all this has resulted in the belief that in the concept of BRICS that was
envisioned, India has emerged as a force to reckon with.

Be it the World Bank, the IMF, Moody's, or various different rating
agencies, they all have been unanimously saying my friends that amongst
all the big countries of the world, the country whose economy is
progressing fastest is  …..(India!)

The country is …(India!)

Dear brothers and sisters,

In the economic state that India is currently, it cannot really do much.
It is a huge country, there is so much poverty, and how can a country
progress in such conditions? But in such adverse conditions also our
country is progressing and the world has started accepting it. India has
created a new identity for itself in the field of science. Earlier, we
were known for Upanishads, India used to be always proud of the
Upanishads, Upanishads and Upanishads but the world could not really
understand it. But today the same country has moved ahead from Upanishads
and started discussing satellites, discussion of satellites!

The success of our Mars Mission…. in the whole world, India is the
first country to be successful in its Mars Mission in the first attempt.
Many countries of the world tried, but they succeeded after multiple
attempts. India succeeded in its first attempt. Similarly, I have also
succeeded in my first attempt.

Why, look at the power of determination of the country, look at the
capability of our nation. Many years back, around the time of Vikram
Sarabhai, Bhabha etc., there used to be conflicts over the fact that
“Our country is poor, why do we need to go to the space? Why are we
spending such huge sum on it? If we do not use satellites, will we not
survive?” These discussions were common in our country. Today, the same
satellites are proving to be very useful to the country. If the farmer
wants any weather related information, he gets it through the satellites.
If the fishermen want to go fishing, all the information about the area,
the distance, availability of fish, can be made available through our
satellites.

When I came to Delhi, I told the officers that “look, the times have
changed, we must embrace e–governance, technology must be used for
governance as much as possible. I have been the chief minister of one
state for a very long time and my experience says that “E–governance is
effective governance, E–governance is easy governance and E–governance is
most economic Governance.” While I was sitting with my officers, I
asked them “How do you use the space technology?” Most of them said
“No, we don't use it much, the people who work for the space are
using it mainly.” I said, “You can use it as well.” I insisted, I
invited the space technology team, got their meetings conducted with
every department and organized workshops, I followed it with them to set
in motion.

Today I am happy to say that in our offices there are around 170 kinds of
small tasks that the Indian government is doing using the space
technology. The way technology has given the world a new strength, a new
direction and therefore we have also are nurtured a dream of Digital
India.

Today, even the poorest person in India uses a mobile phone. A person,
who sells vegetables, keeps a mobile phone. A milkman uses a mobile
phone. A newspaper vendor uses a mobile phone. This is the level of
penetration of technology.  The government should connect with this
phenomenon, and therefore we are thinking about JAM for all. When I talk
of JAM theory, then JAM means…

“J” means Jan Dhan Bank Account. The people among you who belong to
my generation must know that the banks in India were nationalized around
1969, 70,71. It was said that these banks were only serving the rich and
were of no use to the poor and that is why the banks need to be
nationalized. The government took everything in its own hands, they said
that these banks will be open to the poor now.

I have to say with regret today that when I came to Delhi after coming to
power I found out that in our country half of the population has never
even seen the door of a bank. In today's world, the banks prove to be
the back bone of the financial system and if in my country 50percent of the
people stay away from the banking system, how will they be a partner in
the economy of the country.

We undertook the task of opening bank accounts for everyone in 100 days.
You might be thinking what has happened to Mr. Modi?  What could not be
accomplished in 40 years, he wants to accomplish it in 100 days. But my
fellow countrymen you will be happy to know that as a result of this
initiative 18 crore new bank accounts have been opened. The poorest of
the poor has a bank account. They were poor and had no money to open a
bank account, so we made a rule that anyone opening a bank account under
the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana could do so with a zero balance. 
Banking officials were unhappy at this proposition. They said “Sir at
least pay us for the stationary. I said we have enjoyed a lot for the
past 40 years. Now we will have to work hard. See they have to open an
account with zero balance. But I got to witness the richness of the poor.
We are aware of the miserly attitude of the rich, but when the poor
demonstrate their large heartedness, then my heart swells with pride. The
government had said that a bank account can be opened with zero balance,
but the poor through their contributions of Rs. 50, 100 and 200 deposited
a collective amount of 32,000 crores in the bank.

Just see the attitude of my countrymen. Even the poorest of the poor
wants to do something for the country. So the 'J' of the Jan Dhan
Yojana has enabled an efficient economic system.

Second is “A” – Aadhar Card. There is a movement in the entire
country, where every citizen will have an identity card with a special
number under the biometric system, a number which is unique and cannot be
duplicated. Otherwise earlier, a single individual was able to collect
money from 10 different schemes. Aadhar Card has been made the focal
point.

The third is “M”– Mobile governance. Why shouldn't the government
be run through the mobile phone? Why shouldn't the rights of the
citizens be accessible through the mobile?

So we are moving forward keeping “JAM” as focus with people friendly
and people centric welfare policies. And the results are for all to see!

Just tell me – has the corruption ruined the nation or not?.. (Yes!)

Shouldn't the corruption be eliminated?...(Yes!)

But just my not being corrupt will solve the problem? ...(No!)

We have to do much more than that? ...(Yes!)

It can be done without much rhetoric, very silently as I can illustrate
it with an example. The government gives subsidy on the gas cylinders we
use at home. For each cylinder a subsidy of Rs. 150–200 is offered
through the government exchequer so that the gas stove can be used to
make food at your homes. This subsidy is provided to all, be it the rich
or those poor people who have a cylinder. We have decided that the gas
subsidy will be decided on the basis of the number on the Aadhar Card and
thus we can determine who the true beneficiaries are. If the beneficiary
has a Jan Dhan account, then the subsidy will be directly transferred to
his account.

Earlier, 19 crore people were projected users of gas cylinders. That
means the government would pay subsidy for 19 crore gas cylinders each
month. We connected the subsidy to Aadhar and Jan Dhan Yojana. We found
that there were only 13 crore cylinders in circulation. There were no
more owners beyond that. Earlier subsidy for 19 crores was being doled
out, now it has been restricted to 13–14 crores. Where did the subsidy
for that 5 crore cylinders end up if I am to compute from the earlier
price of gas. In the current context, the price of gas cylinder has gone
down, but if I calculate from the older price then around Rs. 19000 crore
were being looted from the exchequer. My friends now all that money is
saved in the government exchequer.  Middlemen and thugs have all been
eliminated through this JAM scheme i. e Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile. Tell
me is the corruption being eliminated or not?...(Yes)

Middlemen have been eliminated or not ? ...(yes)

Money is being saved or not? ...(Yes)

Will this money be used for the poor or not? ...(Yes)

How does change come about? I had casually urged my countrymen, there was
no huge campaign. I had simply requested them, I said “You earn well,
you have industries and factories, you have your own vehicles, then why
do you take this subsidy on cylinder?” I had just mentioned it
casually. But just see the faith of the people of the country. It is
human nature that no one forsakes what he gets for free, howsoever rich a
person may be. But today I mention this with pride and would like to
praise all the 30 lakh people who surrendered their subsidy. 30 lakh
people voluntarily surrendering their subsidy, there can be no more
potent force than that in a nation. And I want to tell you that, it is
this strength that is going to take the nation forward. 

Dear brothers and sisters, for the youth we have launched Skill
Development – each hand should have some skill. If my nation has 800
million youth then they all should be equipped with some skill that will
contribute in creating future India. Our mother and sisters – their
strength should be used in national development hence we have launched
the “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” movement which has gained momentum.
How do my farmers increase their yield? I am a firm believer of use of
technology, so I have started Soil Health Card. In our country we do not
have Health Card for individuals and I propose to create a Health Card
for the farmer's soil. This will enable him to realize the strengths or
the shortcomings of his soil and what can be done to improve it further
and earn more. I have taken such unique initiatives.

Recently I did a small work. The farmers need a lot of urea for their
fields. They use urea in the fields and the government subsidizes it.
Almost Rs. 80,000 crores worth of subsidy is given each year. But how
much this subsidy reaches the farmers and how much of it goes to some
other place, we have no record of that. So we did something, we coated
the urea with neem. Once again, science and technology is the only thing
I can think of. So we coated it with neem. Upon doing so, it cannot be
used for any purpose other than farming. Earlier the urea would be
smuggled to chemical factories. I can say with complete confidence that
next year when the accounts will be settled post harvesting, thousands of
crores would have been saved from pilferage. At the same time my farmer
will have neem coated urea, which will benefit his crops even more. The
fields will have different type of elements and the need for urea will
decline.

Efforts are on in various fields to achieve the pinnacle of success. If I
start mentioning each initiative, then even if I speak for two hours each
day, it will still take me at least 15 days to mention all of them. So
today I am leaving you with a view of a trailer. You will get some idea
how India is making strides towards progress. Today, the world faces two
challenges – one is terrorism and the other is global warming. And it is
my firm belief that if all the humanitarian forces of the world unite,
all people who have faith in humanity unite, then even terrorism can be
defeated and the world could be saved from the perils of global warming.
We can together walk that path. We have accepted these challenges.

India is fully prepared to meet all types of challenges. And today,
wherever in the world we go we discuss this issue very seriously. We have
created a pressure on the UN. The UN is celebrating its 70th anniversary.
Yet United Nations has not been able to define terrorism.  If such a
long time is taken just to define terrorism then how long will it take it
to counter terrorism? I have written letters to all the nations of the
world. And I have told that it is the need of the hour that UN
categorizes certain things as terrorist acts and these are people who
will be defined as supporters of terrorism. It should be clear to the
world about the people who believe in humanity. We should have a clear
definition – who are the terrorists? Who are humanists? Who is standing
with terrorists? All this should now be clearly defined in this world.

I hope and I do sincerely hope that this generation of United Nations
will not be able to ignore this serious problem for very long. The
humanist forces of the world will have to pressurize that it be decided
once and for all, in black and white, what the definition of terrorism
is? In the absence of the definition of terrorism, words like 'good
terrorism' and 'bad terrorism' are prevalent. We cannot save
humanity from this good terrorism and bad terrorism.

Terrorism is just terrorism. And today, I remember my visit of 1993 where
I met the representatives of the State Department and explained them how
terrorism is a nuisance in our country and that so many innocent people
are being killed by the terrorists. They in their turn explained me that
this is not terrorism, but a law and order problem. I said “It is not
law and order problem, it is terrorism” but they were not ready to
listen. I came back again after a year, then they asked for an
appointment with me. I was surprised as I was not holding any position,
but then I agreed to meet them.  So the next time they asked me “what
is terrorism”.  So I said, “Nothing, but some law and order
problem”. They then urged me to explain what terrorism is. I asked
“How have you suddenly become enlightened? Why have you started
bothering about terrorism, please tell me. My nation has been suffering
for the past 40 years because of terrorism. We have been explaining
people how innocents are being needlessly killed. But, the world is
instead questioning us. I asked what was the reason behind this sudden
enlightenment. Well there had been an explosion in their stock market. It
was that explosion that made them realize what terrorism in India is. And
only then they started acknowledging it.

The world needs to understand this. Do not think it is somebody else's
problem and it will not affect us. It can reach any corner of the world.
So all the humanitarian forces need to come together in this fight
against terrorism. This is the need of the world and we should be
prepared to fulfill it. And I am out to convey this message. And today,
when UN is celebrating its 70th anniversary, it is its responsibility to
present to the world a clear picture of who it deems as terrorists and
who are humanists. The picture should be clear once and for all so that
the world can decide which path to follow. And then only will there be
peace in the world.

We come from the land where Gandhi and Buddha were born. Siddhartha was
born in Nepal, but after coming to Bodh Gaya he became Buddha.  The land
which has given the world the mantra of non–violence can request the
world that 21st century should not be tainted with the blood of
innocents.  We will have to save the 21st century from being tainted by
violence. I have very strongly put forth my point in the UN . I am going
again tomorrow and I will repeat it again.

My dear brothers and sisters of California, I am extremely grateful for
the love, the welcome and the respect shown by you all. And all of us,
all the 125 crore Indians will work to fulfill the dream of every Indian.
There should be welfare of the poorest of the poor, employment for the
youth, respect for women, the farmers are happy and prosperous and there
is a change in the lives of the villagers and villages and we have
embarked on that journey.

May we continue to receive your blessings, with these expectations I
thank you all once again.

And I express my deep gratitude to all the Senators and Congressmen who
came here in large numbers and expressed their love and solidarity for
India. I express thanks to all the esteemed leaders who are representing
the American politics for coming here in large numbers and gracing this
occasion.

Please close your fist and call out loudly with me,

Bharat Mata Ki …(Jai)

Your voice should reach India. 

Bharat Mata Ki …(Jai)

Bharat Mata Ki …(Jai)

Bharat Mata Ki …(Jai)

Bharat Mata Ki………(Jai)

Once again we will remember the brave Bhagat Singh

Veer Bhagat Singh …(Long live! Long live!)

Veer Bhagat Singh ... (Long live! Long live!)

Veer Bhagat Singh ... (Long live! Long live!)



Thank You Very Much!

"i77719","t20181218678247","My dear brothers and sisters who have gathered here in large numbers!

Mumbai and Thane are those parts of the country that have aided in fulfilling the dreams of the nation. Many ordinary people from small villages and towns have attained fame and prosperity here. Those who are born here and live here are generous and benevolent. The people here have offered a place in their hearts for everyone. This is the reason why the complete spectrum of India can be seen here. Whoever comes here gets immersed in the colour of Mumbai and becomes a part of the Marathi culture.

Brothers and sisters,

Today Mumbai is expanding and is undergoing all-round development. However, it is putting a pressure on the resources at the same time. Its impact can particularly be seen on its transport system, roads and railways. Keeping this in mind, in the last four or four and a half years, sustained efforts have been made to improve the transport system of several adjacent areas including Mumbai and Thane.

Foundation-stones of the projects worth more than Rs. 33 thousand crores laid today also include 2 projects of metro lines. Besides, projects related to the construction of houses for 90000 poor and middle class families were started today in Thane.

Friends,

Transportation is an important dimension of any city or country's development. India is among those countries that are undergoing rapid urbanization.

As per a recent research study, in the coming decades, all the top 10 cities with fastest rate of development will be from India. That is, one strong factor of rapid development of our country is the people living in our cities. Mumbai, in any case, has always been the centre of economic activities in our country. And in the future, this is going to expand. Therefore, after the BJP-led NDA government was formed at the centre, we started focusing upon the infrastructure of this place.

Several crores were allocated for the Mumbai local trains. The old railway bridges were modernized. Apart from Mumbai local, other modes of transport were also expanded, of which the metro rail system became one influential medium.

After the expansion of metro in Thane, it will provide a better connectivity to Mumbai, Thane and other nearby regions.

Friends,

The first project of the Mumbai metro came up in 2006. However, it is difficult to state as to where this project got stuck-up for eight years.

The first line could be started in 2014 and that too for just 11 kilometres. Only 11 kilometres in 8 years!

After 2014 we decided that both the speed as well as the scale of laying metro lines would be increased.

In the last four years, various new projects were started to lay a network of metro in Mumbai.

In keeping with this idea, the foundation-stones of two more metro lines were laid today. That is, in the next three years, 35 kilometres long metro line will be added to the existing network.

Besides, between 2022 and 2024, the people of Mumbai will get 275-km long metro line.

The projects whose foundation-stones have been laid today will not only benefit the people of cities like Thane , Bhiwandi, Kalyan, Dahisar and Mira Bhavandar but will also put an end to the issue of traffic jams in Mumbai.

Friends,

These facilities are in accordance with not only today's requirements, but also with the needs of the year 2035.

Brothers and sisters,

We are trying to ensure that along with making your lives better and easier, the poor and the middle class people too get houses to live in.

The central government has decided that by 2022 when India will be celebrating 75 years of independence, every family of the country must have its own house with cemented roof. Moving towards the same goal, today the construction work for 90 thousand new houses has begun.

Friends,

Our work culture, attitude and speed are different from that of the previous government. The previous government had constructed only 25. 5 lakh houses in the last four years of their tenure i. e. 25 lakh 50 thousand while in the last four years our government has constructed more than 1 crore 25 lakh houses for the people. This is more than 5 times. This means that if they had to make such a progress, it would have probably taken 2 generations to complete the work.

Under Pradhan Mantri Shahri Awas Yojana, 8 lakh houses are being constructed in the entire Maharashtra. Friends, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, good, society flats are being constructed for the homeless. And this will not be like the Adarsh society that was in news during the tenure of the previous government. In fact, Adarsh or an ideal society is being created in true terms where the dreams of ordinary men and women are nurtured and self-confidence for a better future develops.

Under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, financial assistance of up to Rs. 2. 5 lakh is being deposited in the bank accounts by our government. That is the loan amount of Rs. 2. 5 lakh immediately gets reduced which means the poor and the middle class is getting help even in home loans.

Besides, the interest rates on home loans have also been reduced considerably compared to before. Under this scheme, interest subsidy of 6. 5% is being provided to the people from Economically Weaker Sections and Low Income Groups by the government.

People from Middle Income Group have been provided an interest subsidy of 3-4%. This means if someone has taken a home loan of 20 lakh rupees for 20 years, then he will get an assistance of about Rs. 6 lakh from the government during this period. Friends,

As a result of these honest efforts of the government, lakhs of people have booked, purchased their first house in the last 1-1. 5 year.

As per a report, the rate of buying a new house in the last 7-8 months has more than doubled compared to the previous year.

I am told that the scheme that is being launched today will also help such people. More than 85 thousand people in Maharashtra have received an assistance of Rs. 2000 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Friends,

We are aiding the middle class not only for getting them a house but also for addressing all the related issues.

Till four years back, you are well aware of the kind of problems that you had to face while getting the house booked with your entire life's savings.

You were unable to get hold of your house because of arbitrariness and pernicious intensions of certain people. There also were cases where something was promised but entirely a different thing was delivered. Our government has made a great effort to curb this trend.

Today Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) has been notified in most states of the country. The Tribunal too is in operation in 21 states.

I congratulate Fadnavis ji because Maharashtra is one of the states in the country which has implemented RERA first. Nearly 35,000 real estate projects and 27,000 real estate agents across the country have been registered. And Maharashtra has the highest number of projects in it.

Friends,

Just imagine, the real estate sector was in operation without any definite law for the past 70 years. Had the previous governments created similar laws before, then the home buyers wouldn't have had to approach the court and the real estate sector would have transparently flourished.

Brothers and sisters,

The government is relentlessly making efforts to help the lower and the middle income groups reduce their electricity bills. More than 30 crore LED bulbs have been distributed across the country under UJALA scheme. Out of these, 2. 25 crore bulbs have been distributed in Maharashtra and lakhs of bulbs have also been distributed in Thane. The work done by a 60 Watt bulb is not being done by bulbs of 7-8 Watt. This means that electricity is being saved and the electricity bill is getting reduced.

With the help of just this scheme, several families of this country are now able to save nearly Rs. 16 thousand crores annually. Maharashtra alone has saved electricity bill of Rs. 1100 Crores per year.

This was possible because we worked on LED bulbs on mission mode encouraged the companies to increase their production, promoted competition and removed the middlemen. Consequently, the LED bulbs that used to cost around Rs. 250-300 till four years ago, now cost Rs. 50.

Friends,

The central government is moving ahead on the path of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. Efforts are being made so that no village, city or class of the country remains untouched by development. Schemes are being formulated and implemented so as to uplift the standard of living of the poor.

Under the Ujjwala scheme, free gas connections are being provided across the country to make the lives of the poor sisters smoke-free and also to save their time.

So far, about 6 crore connections have been given across the country of which more than 34 lakh sisters belong to Maharashtra including Thane.

Friends,

The doors of the banks are always open for those sisters who want to start their small businesses - like salon, tailoring, weaving, handicraft etc.

Under the MUDRA Yojana, loans between Rs 50 thousand and Rs. 10 lakh is being given without guarantee. About 1. 25 crore such loans have been given in Maharashtra, of which 1 crore are in the name of sisters.

Brothers and sisters,

Our aim is to provide a dignified life to the poor and the women.

Our government is dedicated to the five streams of development - education for children, income for the youth, medicines for the elderly, irrigation for the farmers and hearing for the masses.

In the end, once again, I congratulate you all for the new projects of development. I am really grateful to you all for coming here in such large numbers and showering your blessings.

I will be going to Pune from here. I will be launching and laying the foundation-stones of projects worth thousands of crores even there. I congratulate you for showing this great strength by assembling here in huge numbers!

Ministers of India and Bangladesh,
Young MPs and leaders from Bangladesh come to India,
And all India and Bangladesh colleagues associated with this live telecast,

Hi!

Asha Kori's Bangladeshe Shobe Bhalo Achhe!

First of all, I congratulate the people of Bangladesh for the successful conduct of the general election. Also, I congratulate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ji for her historic victory with a very big mandate.

Friends,

This is my sixth video conference with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ji. So simply, and so often, the interaction between the leadership of any two countries, shows in itself how deep and strong the relations between the two countries are. This video conference is happening at a very special time. In the same month, the birth centenary celebrations of Bangabandhu are going to begin in Bangladesh from March 17, and then on March 26, the 48th anniversary of the independence of Bangladesh will also be celebrated. We will also celebrate festivals.

|
Friends,

Whenever there is talk of strengthening connectivity between India and Bangladesh, I consider Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ji's vision as her biggest inspiration. And, therefore, I am very happy that today we have not only transport, but also knowledge. India has also taken steps to increase connectivity. By connecting with Bangladesh, India's National Knowledge Network will now become a strong link connecting Bangladesh's scholars and research institutions with India and the world. And the supply of trucks will play a supporting role in the efforts by the Bangladesh government to provide affordable public transport. Water Treatment Plants will deliver pure drinking water to thousands of homes. And Community Clinics will benefit about 2 lakh people who will have health services near their homes. All these projects are directly related to public life. These projects show that India-Bangladesh relations are playing an important and positive role in improving the quality of life of the people of both countries.

Friends,

The people of India and Bangladesh have a relationship full of intimacy and family feelings. The development of Bangladesh is not only a matter of happiness for India, but also a source of inspiration for us. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has set ambitious goals for the development of Bangladesh. It is a matter of pride for us to cooperate in realizing Bangladesh's vision of making Bangladesh a middle income country by 2021, and a developed country by 2041.

Excellency,

I consider it my great privilege to work with you for the Shonali chapter of India-Bangladesh relations in the last five years. And I am confident that the last five years have been as glorious for us as our bilateral in the next five years. Relationships will achieve even greater heights. This is my belief as well as commitment. And this belief of mine has become even stronger today, because today I had the opportunity to meet many young MPs and leaders from Bangladesh. I see the bright future of India-Bangladesh relations in his talent and hard work.

"i55383","t20110318125659","Mr. Birthe Foster, the Chairperson of EBG, Excellencies, Leaders of the European and Indian corporate world, Ladies and Gentlemen!

At the very outset, I wish to compliment the organizers for choosing this topic. It is not only relevant for the economy but also for the humanity. It is also a matter very close to my heart. Such deliberations help us a lot in learning from each other. I have been a firm believer in noble intentions in every human being. We all want to do good. And the collective wisdom does give us the way forward. In fact, the term leadership has a wider meaning. There are leaders in every walk of life. The real work of a true leader is to unleash that creativity of the people around him. If we encourage leaders in all fields, there would be automatic balance in the society and economy. We have to work on this collective strength of the people.

Friends! I think after the world wars, this is the most critical moment in human history. Established theories are getting diluted. Our beliefs are getting tested. Our structures are still looking for the capacity to withstand the nature. Our safety nets are not safe enough. Our systems are not strong to safeguard us before human and natural adventures. Employment and livelihood is not secure for all time. Infrastructure and amenities are not sustainable. But we have to live and have to live in a better way. For this, we have to make this world a better place to live. Not only for ourselves, but also for the coming generations. The option is not to escape from the reality. The option is also not to disappear from this planet. There is a common belief that if you are living at a particular place, you are better off. But recent economic crisis and natural disasters have shown that it is not so. So WHERE do we live is not an important question. To my mind, the important question is HOW do we live?

Friends! To say conclusively as to how do we live is not easy. Unfortunately, there are very few models left on which we can rely. All philosophies have been tested. All technologies have been tried. The industrial revolution gave us the confidence that we can make anything. The world wars gave the confidence that we can destroy anything. But when it comes to development of all, no theory, philosophy or strategy has proved to be enough. There have been elections, civil unrest and wars in the name of equality and justice. But we all know where we stand. What is the reason for this situation? The answer, to my mind, is within us. We have to look within. The biggest problem of the present model of development is that it is based on exploitation. Exploitation of nature and its resources. Exploitation of the poor by the rich. Exploitation of one part of the world by another part. Exploitation of the feelings of the common man through dreams of consumerism. It will not work for a long time.

The answer is not in exploitation. The answer is in nurturing. We have to find and exchange technologies which ensure maximum productivity from minimum usage of natural resources. The 'throw away' culture is not sustainable. This is leading to a mad rush of consumerism. By the time we get used to one particular model of an instrument, there is a newer version. What we need is satisfaction and value for the consumer. Only the satisfaction of the producer is not enough. Moreover, we have to use our resources in a manner that the same is available in equal or greater measure for the posterity. Unfortunately, the term 'development' has become a limited concept. It is understood as relating only to economic development and physical wellbeing. Moreover, it attempts to meet only the present demands. While nurturing takes a holistic view of the situation. It combines the people, resources and amenities. It combines the past, the present and the future . A holistic view of human life and the surroundings is essential for our sustainable development . I can say that such models are available in many emerging nations . I have the humility to say that India presents a premier model in a situation like this .

India has been a society and culture of nurturing and nourishment . We have been told to thank and seek forgiveness from the mother earth as soon as we get up in the morning . We have been told not only to plant trees but to preserve and worship them . We have been told to raise cattle, feed them and pray for their well being if we want our good fortunes . We have been told to treat the entire universe as one family . These thoughts are embedded in our culture and scriptures . Since ancient times, our society has practiced them . However, it was Mahatma Gandhi who showed us that these ideals work even in the modern age . Friends! In this light, I can answer your topic in one line. And the answer is that we have to look towards Mahatma Gandhi. There can not be a better guide to balance the conflicting demands of present day. The conflicts are there for economic growth, disaster management and ecological conservation. The challenge is to ensure smooth, equitable and sustainable development .

Thus, living in harmony with the nature; living with compassion for others is the only way to live happily . I have not read anything more profound than what Gandhi has told for the people like us sitting here . And this is relevant for the entire topic of today. He said, “If you are in a dilemma, just remember the face of the last person who is going to be affected by your decision”. So, 'UNTO THE LAST' is the best guiding principle for balancing the economic growth and development. However, we have misinterpreted it to mean just 'trickle down' of wealth and development . This is not enough .

Just distribution is not enough . It will not reach till the last person . It will not reach to him at the time when he needs it . It will not be available in the manner he needs it . What we need is the models of development where people are not just beneficiaries . Rather they are made equal partners in the process of development . People should be in the beginning of the development cycle, not at the end . Someone had said 'Small is Beautiful' . But, unfortunately, small became a synonym of poverty . Actually, it is not so . Even in the midst of robustness, there may be small devices and structures which are closer to the nature . Even amidst the mega creations, there may be small mechanisms which empower and take care of the last person . This is essential . The 'Big' will not be sustainable unless its foundation lies in the small . Small devices, small mechanisms, and above all, the feelings of the small man .

Friends! You must be aware that Gujarat is the birth place of Gandhi . And then who else will follow what he said, if we don't . I must admit that our eyes are always on robust and faster economic growth . I always say 'Gujarat's growth is needed for India's growth' . We are committed to contribute immensely to India's faster growth . However, Gujarat's growth model is very different . It is a very unique model .

    Our Growth is with active participation of people
    Our Growth is a mass movement
    Our growth is both robust and pervasive
    Our growth is both quantitative and qualitative

Friends! 'India Has Emerged' is the buzz word all around the world today . However, to make India's emergence steady and sustainable, we in the States have to put up strong foundations . I am happy to say that Gujarat represents the elements of such a strong foundation . Its fundamentals are strong . They are strong not in a particular sector but all across the economic sectors . Its vibrancy can be felt not only in economic activities but also in social life . Its richness can be seen not only in its infrastructure but also in its flora and fauna.

    Gujarat is a place where rural development has kept pace with urban Growth
    Gujarat is a place where agriculture has kept pace with industry
    Gujarat is a place where wellbeing of workers has kept pace with industrialization

Friends! Gujarat has emerged as the Growth Engine of India not only because it contributes immensely in its economic growth . Actually, the bigger success is that it has an amazing mix of the big and small; robust and inclusive; fast and yet sustainable . It has done wonderfully well on both the Macro and the Micro indicators . Our growth rate of GDP has been in double digits for a decade . At the same time, the per capita income of the people has also grown at the fastest rate of 13. 8percent . Not only the multinationals and big companies have done well, but a large number of SMEs have also prospered . Not only the industry has grown at 13percent but agriculture has also grown at 9. 6percent . We have not only created world's largest multi–purpose dam but also several hundred thousands of small water harvesting structures . We have not only added Megawatts to our electric generation, but have also taken to the remotest households giving them power on a 24X7 basis (Jyotigram scheme) . We have not only created world class roads and ports, but also rooms and toilets in all our schools . We have not only created world class institutions, but have also ensured 100percent enrollment in elementary education .

Gujarat's growth is sufficiently uniform and inclusive . However, our present emphasis is on better Human Development Index . On the one hand, we have created world class hospitals . At the same time, we have made the poor people get easy access to the medical facilities (Chiranjeevi Yojna) . On the one hand, we export quality industrial products of the country and on the other, our farmers supply important agri and dairy produce in the foreign countries . There is a long list of the things in Gujarat which are innovative, modern and progressive . And yet they are humanitarian solutions to our problems . This is the reason that Gujarat's multi–faceted growth and excellence has been recognized not only in the country but in the entire world . This is because we work with people . We work holistically and strengthen the entire value chain .

To give a few examples:

    In water: From harvesting to its economic use leading to high agri–productivity
    In agriculture: from farm to factory, from factory to fashion from fashion to foreign .
    In energy: from generation to management and its conservation and saving
    In forestry: from conservation to social forestry to creation of forests based on the planets and stars

Gujarat represents an enterprising spirit . It has a development friendly environment . Gujarat is a place where democratization has gone to the next level of innovation . We have created participatory institutions of new age which will be reckoned as models in the years to come . Our Panchayati Raj and Co–operative institutions have taken deep roots . To add to that, we have launched several long–lasting initiatives . One of them is a technology enabled State wide Grievance Redressal System called SWAGAT . The United Nations has given Public Service Award to my office for this programme . Similarly, in our attempt to take the Government closer to the people, we have reorganized our sub–district level administration . Our efforts in Good Governance have been applauded the world over . We have received more than 200 national and international awards in the last eight years . We are getting such awards on a weekly basis . They are in recognition of excellence in various fields . However, we treat these awards as just milestones in our journey . They are only indicators that we are in the right direction . We are constantly improving our standards . Alongwith many offices of the State, my own office is an ISO certified office .

Friends! To sum up, I must reiterate that if you want sustainability in development, the whole world has to be viewed as one organic unit . We have seen that in bad times of the Global economy, it was the emerging nations who sustained the pace of economy . They did it through creation of demand for the products and thus creation of jobs . It was they who helped in sustaining global recovery during the recession . However, even when the time is good, the whole world treats them just as markets . I will give you only one example . We all know that thermal energy is too expensive from the viewpoint of its carbon footprint . We have seen recently that even Nuclear energy can be very expensive for human lives . Their adverse impacts are felt for several generations . The developed world wants renewable and eco–friendly sources of energy to be exploited . This is indeed the need of the hour . But then we are not getting the technology at cheaper prices . We all know that given the high input prices, we can not do it with the desired momentum . We, in Gujarat, have started harnessing the wind and solar energy in a big way . I am personally committed for it and we are going ahead . I firmly believe that we must tackle the issues impacting the climate . We can not ignore it any longer . In fact, in order to give focus and to work in organised manner on the climate change issues, we have created a full fledged department for Climate Change . We have taken a lot of measures in this direction . Some of these measures have been listed in my recent book 'Convenient Action' .

So, if we want the world to be a better place to live, we have to treat it as one unit. If we want economic growth to be pervasive, we have to make people its partners . If we want the process of development to be sustainable, we have to work with the environment. If we want our coming generations to enjoy the fruits of development, we have to nurture the nature . Even at the cost of repetition, I would say that India is an excellent model in this regard . India has the power of new energy in the form of its youth. India has the strength of its tradition in the form of its caring culture. India has the warmth of participation in the form of its democracy. The whole world has seen during the recession that India has its inherent strength to withstand a crisis. A strength, which is rooted in its universal thinking and interdependence .

And friends ! Gujarat always represents the best of what is India

"i70233","t20170309109699","Welcome friends, 

All of us are back together once again after the recess during the Budget
Session of the Parliament. There will be detailed discussion on the
Budget and I am sure the level of debate and discussion will be of good
quality. It will be focused on the issues pertaining to the welfare of
the poor. We are hopeful of a breakthrough in the GST. One of the reasons
for our optimism is that all the states have cooperated in a positive
manner. All the political parties have also been extremely positive and
cooperative in their response. We have been able to move forward in this
direction after arriving at a consensus on certain decisions subsequent
to detailed discussion on this issue in a democratic manner. The efforts
are on to enlist the co–operation of  all to ensure that GST is in place
by this session. I am extremely thankful to all of you once again.

"i78583","t20190303665129","Have to speak cheerfully. And I will call three different cheers. I want to say Jay Jay ki jai ki jaikara. For mighty India - Bharat Mata Ki - Jayajra speak with full force - For mighty India - Bharat Mata Ki - Jayavijayi for India - Bharat Mata Ki - Jaivir for young men - Bharat Mata Ki - Jai very much. Thank you very much for Uttar Pradesh. Mr. Yogi Adityanath, the popular and famous Chief Minister, my colleague of the Council of Ministers at the center, the country's Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ji, fellow sister of the Council of Ministers Smriti E. The Ani-law, State Minister Mohsin Raza G Suresh Pasi law, legislators Mayankeshwar Sharan Singh, Garima Singh, Dal Bahadur Corey G, my dear brothers and sisters, Jai Ram UP law. And how are you doing Logan. All right. All of you have gathered in such a large number, I salute you all. This land has been the taphobhoomi of the Maharaja of Tikarmabhi. This land is the land of Baba Purushottam Das, the creator of Jaimina Mahapuran, Malik Mohammed Jayasi, National President of Arya Samaj and MLA of Jana Sangh, Raja Raman Jayasi. I bow to this land. I have come among you today to further expand the development work done by our government for the development of Uttar Pradesh and Amethi in the last four and a half years, and I saw that we are still welcome Meghraja has also pleased to do. And I remember equally that in 98 I came here to hold a public meeting with Atalji and that day there was heavy rain; All the systems were destroyed and since then I have been coming to Amethi for the work of some organization. After becoming Prime Minister, today we have the opportunity to come once again among you. At the time of elections in 2014, we said - Sabka Saath - Sabka Vikas. My dear brothers and sisters of Amethi, Amethi is an excellent example of the mantra of development for all of us. And when we talk about the development of everyone, I used to say that even today, those who voted for us are also ours, those who did not vote are also ours. Those who gave us seats, that area is also ours and those who did not give us seats, that area is also ours. And today, after five years, I can say with great pride by bowing before the citizens of Amethi that sister Smriti Irani Came among you as a candidate; You had a new face, a new introduction, but you gave many blessings. Even though we could not win the election at that time, but we were successful in winning your heart. You have given so much love that for five years Smriti has worked so hard for the development of this region, never let you feel that you have defeated or won them; Have shown more work than won. I want to ask the people of Amethi - are you satisfied with our work? Have we worried about you Have we sincerely tried to do you good? Have we done any injustice even at night? Has done justice completely This is our all-together development mantra. Hundreds of crores of projects related to the development of Amethi have been inaugurated and laid. It includes schools, roads, medical centers, cowsheds, electricity, many agricultural projects. Brothers and sisters, today I am going to make a very important announcement with these projects. This announcement is associated with Amethi's new identity, Nai Shaan. How many big leaders must have come here; Now Amethi is not in his name in future; The plan I brought today will be known. Brothers and sisters, now the world's most modern, one of the world's most modern guns in the ordnance factory of Korba - AK203 i.e. the most innovative weapon of the series of kalashnikovs rifles, these Will be made in our Amethi. These rifles will form a joint venture between Russia and India. A while back, our country's first Defense Minister Nirmala has also read the message of the President of Russia here. I thank President Putin, a very close friend of mine and India, for this partnership. This joint venture has been possible with their cooperation in a very short time. I am also very grateful to President Putin for his friendly message and best wishes; At the same time, I thank the Russian friends associated with this joint venture and congratulations and best wishes for its success. Friends, some people keep wandering around the world visiting every village - Made in Ujjain, Made in Jaipur, Made In Jaisalmer, Made in Baroda - he keeps on giving speeches. His speech remains speechless. This is Modi, now Made in Amethi, this made in Amethi, made in Amethi AK203 rifles are definitely going to give our soldiers a lot of edge in encounters with terrorists and Naxals. These rifles will be made in lakhs in Amethi factory. Going forward, the rifle that will be manufactured here will also be exported to other countries of the world. Therefore, this factory is also creating new employment opportunities for the youth of Amethi and is also opening a new path for the development and security of the country. Brothers and sisters, the work which is being started here today, this work 8- Should have started 9 years ago. This factory of Korba was built so that a modern rifle can be made here, but its full capacity has never been used. This Amethi factory is a witness to how the needs of our army and security forces were ignored earlier. Friends, for the safety of the countryOur army had put its need of modern weapon in front of the government in the year 2005. In view of this, work started for that factory in Amethi. Your MP, when he laid the foundation stone in 2007 - it was said that work will start in 2010. What happened, what happened? Didn't he say that? Was it not his government? What should they say that should not have happened? What happened? Hey, who can't do that much, trust them? But friends, far from the start of work, for three years after the foundation stone, the earlier government could not decide what kind of weapons would be made in the ordnance factory here. Not only that - where the factory will be built, the land has not been provided for it. Friends, think - the factory in which the work should have started in the year 2010, its building was hanging till 2013. After the construction of the building, work started here as it was, because there was an election in front, it was necessary to show something, but the modern rifle was not made even then. And here, yes, don't forget that in the factory they promised - they say no, we play by promise, we never lie - they also lie a lot. And don't forget this too - he said that he promised to provide employment to 1500 youth. Brother, promised 1500 people in the factory? This is the matter of Amethi, I am not doing the country. But the people who spoke so big, shook the eyes of the people of Amethi and only 200 people got work, and today, they are moving around the country giving speeches of employment. My brothers and sisters of Amethi, now wait for so many years After the construction of one of the most modern rifles in the world is going to start in the ordnance factory of Amethi. Friends, I want to know from you whether our heroic jaw by not making modern rifles Is there injustice with both of them? Did it happen or not? Did the resources of the ordnance factory not utilize its full potential, or was there injustice with the resources here? Was there any injustice to the youth of Amethi by not giving them employment? Friends, the government which was earlier, left no stone unturned to ignore the security of the security forces. It is necessary to remind the country again and again how our brave soldiers were craved for bulletproof jackets. In the year 2009, the army had demanded one lakh 88 thousand bullet proof jackets. Without a bullet proof jacket, our youth was facing the enemy's bullets and the guerrilla action of the terrorists. Used to do dangerous encounters with terrorists by putting his life at stake. From 2009 to 2014, five years - five years is not a short time, but a bullet proof jacket was not purchased for the army. This is our government, which has ordered to buy more than two lakh 30 thousand bullet proof jackets in the last four and a half years. I have come to Amethi today and I want to know from you that the brave soldiers of the country are waiting for the rifle. Who were these people waiting for the make-up, bullet proof jacket? Who were the people? I will not take anyone's name, but you know very well who these people were, you know very well who they were. And so brothers and sisters- Bharat Mata ki Jai. And so, brothers and sisters, you know I do not need to name anyone. Brothers and sisters, these people have made our country not only a modern rifle, not a modern bullet proof jacket, but also a modern cannon. It is our government that has made the modern cannon deal and now it is being made in India itself. Friends, like the modern cannon, our air force has been saying for decades for modern fighter aircraft, but whose intentions are bad, Where will they hear the voice of the Air Force. These people sat on the Rafale aircraft deal for years and threw it in the cold storage when it came to go to the government. It is the effort of our government that in the next few months the first Rafale aircraft will be in the skies of India. But these people, they are still doing some new tantrums of the Rafale aircraft deal for their personal selfishness, for personal interest, to thwart it, too. Brothers and sisters, From the Supreme Court to the CAG, every institution is saying that the Government of India has taken the right decision, done it at the right time, done the right deal and done in the interest of the country. But these people are being lied to on lies. What is the unhappiness of not getting commission in the defense deal can be seen clearly on the faces of some people. Friends, half-heartedly like these people did not care about the security of the country, the same behavior of the people of Amethi. Has also been done with. What was said for Amethi, but what is the situation of Amethi today, who knows this better than you. Brothers and sisters, when there is no intention, when there is no intention of doing good to the poor, when only lies to people This is the result if you want to lie. You remember, the steel factory here also went away because gas was not provided for it. The same was done with the Meghapur foodpark here. At the same time, when we thought about the steel factory, we made arrangements for a gas pipeline. Now this steel factory is ready to give employment to Amethi and give further impetus to the steel production in the country. Brothers and sisters, what happened to the bicycle factory in Goliganj. Took land from the farmers, yes, took the land from the farmers, did not set up the factory and the land got its name from the back doorDid it. This is played by your feelings in the name of development of Amethi. Friends, when power becomes selfish, expansion of heritage becomes the only goal, then it is very natural to leave behind the needs of the country. When the welfare of his people and his relatives becomes a priority, then the sense of well being of the common man ends. Unfortunately this is what happened to Amethi. I was watching a TV report. It showed a report of a Dalit colony here. It was told that the houses that were given to the Dalits in 2008, they have come to the brink of falling situation within ten years. The people of those settlements were telling that the MP here gave his name to the settlements, but he was forgotten after that. Friends, you are witness to how the people of Amethi were treated. And today you are also seeing how our government has done development work here. Under the Prime Minister Housing Scheme, more than 9 thousand such houses have been constructed in Amethi. There has been an attempt to make the lives of the people here easier by providing free gas connections under the Ujjwala scheme, by providing free electricity connections under the Saubhagya scheme, by constructing toilets. , Some people have a tendency. They want to keep the poor poor so that generation after generation can raise slogans of poverty removal. By empowering the poor, we are giving him so much strength that he gets out of his poverty fast. This is the reason that today India is counted in those countries where poverty is decreasing very fast. Some people have not been sensitive towards the poor, their needs. Friends, what was done to the poor, the same happened to the farmers of the country. These people never tried to empower the farmers. He kept ignoring his small and big problems. When the farmer was upset with their schemes, they used to implicate him in the confusion of loan waiver. The last time in 2008, they waived a loan of Rs 52 thousand crores whereas the farmers of the country had a loan of Rs 6 lakh crores. There are 100 farmers in the village, so hardly 20 or 25 farmers got benefit. The rest of the loan waivers were taken away by their soldiers, contractors, brokers, middlemen. At the same time, 12 crore farmers of the country are sure to get the benefit of the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana that our government has brought. A few days ago the first installment of two thousand rupees has also reached the account of crores of farmers. Those farmers who have not received money in their account, they will also get the benefit of this very soon. Friends, this scheme is so big that in the coming ten years, seven and a half lakh crore rupees will directly reach the farmers' account. Think how much power this is going to give to the villages of the country, to the farmers, to the rural economy. This will benefit thousands of farmers of Amethi too. Buy fertilizer, buy seeds, pay electricity bills, buy pesticides; He will be able to do all such work with this money. Brothers and sisters, be it farmers, young people or young sons and daughters of our country, your chief servant is able to work today, so there is your power behind this, your blessing. . Seeing your enthusiasm, I can say that the people of Amethi and Amethi are going to create a new history. A history whose echo will be heard all over the country. Friends, I also give special thanks to Smriti who has done many works for the development of Amethi. Together once again the Russian President Putin ji, whose message was read by the country's first defense minister Nirmalaji; I thank them too, and the world has now fully understood what the women's power of India is. The country whose defense minister is a woman, has shown the world how steps are taken to protect the country. Once again, I am seeing such a huge mass city from Amethi here. You came to bless us, I thank you very much from my heart. Speak with me - Bharat Mata Ki - Jayabharat Mata Ki - Jai very thank you.","pms","modi","2019","201903","20190303","pmo","firstterm","nda2","nationalpol","speech","other","other","other","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hindiother","despiteprojectingarequirementforbulletproofjacketsin2009nosuchjacketswereprocuredtill2014pmmodiimplementationofschemessuchaspmawasyojanaujjwalayojanasaubhagyayojana","httpswwwnarendramodiintextofpmsaddressattheunveilingofvariousdevelopmentprojectsinamethiup","nmo2019","59","5405","gt","saksham","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","modi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","nmo_spe","na","yes","others","m","bjp","nmo_nt","nmo_nda2","bjp_spe","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","m_spe","m_nt","m_nda2","pms2019","pms_spe","pms_nt","pms_nda2","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_pe2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_pe2_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_pe2_nt","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_pe2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_pe2_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_pe2_nt","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_pe2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_pe2_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_pe2_nt","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_pe2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_pe2_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_pe2_nt","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","nmo","nmo","nmo","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiother","pmsgt","nmo","nt","spe","f","bjp_nmo","bjp_spe","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_nmo","lib_spe","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2019","lib_bjp_spe","nmo_spe_2019","nmo_nt_2019","bjp_spe_2019","bjp_nt_2019","other","o201903","nmo_spe_201903","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_nt","pms_spe","pms_nt","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","Ms","Ms","Ms","Ms",NA,NA,NA,2672
"i68699","t20160926521635","Let me begin by congratulating the Indian Space Research Organisation for
successfully undertaking one of its most challenging satellite launches.

As many as eight satellites have been launched in two different orbits,
in a single PSLV flight.

I am privileged to inaugurate CSIR's Platinum Jubilee Function on the
occasion of its Seventy–Fifth Foundation Day.

Also as President of the Council, let me take this opportunity to welcome
you all for the year–long Celebrations of CSIR Platinum Jubilee.

I specially welcome the One Hundred and Fifty Science students from
Kendriya Vidyalayas, who are present here today, as well as the students
and research scholars at IITs and IISERs, who are watching this event
live.

It is a matter of pride for every Indian that CSIR is celebrating 75th
year of committed contribution to the development of modern India.

This has been a journey dedicated to the Nation.

Starting with the indelible ink which is the hallmark of our democratic
fabric, CSIR has left an indelible mark on every sphere of life.

With an all–round approach to Research and Development CSIR is a
reflection of India in its diversity and heterogeneity.

From agriculture to aerospace, bio–sensors to bio–pharmaceuticals,
chemicals to climate change, drug development to deep sea explorations,
from earth sciences to energy, food to fragrance, glass to genomics,
housing to healthcare, instrumentation to informatics, leather to Light
Combat Aircraft, microbes to mining to materials, optics to optical
fibres, pigments to power electronics, roads to robotics, sensors to
solar energy, tractors to transport, UAVs to under water vehicles, and
water to weather forecasting, CSIR has registered its presence.

Swaraj, the first Tractor of the country, Baby Milk Powder, the first
Super Computer of the country; these are just some of the accomplishments
of CSIR.

Before arriving in this hall, I saw the achievements of CSIR show–cased
in an exhibition. I would like to see this exhibition taken to other
parts of the country, so that people can know and appreciate CSIR's
achievements.

Our efforts should be to prepare CSIR for modern technologies and
emerging challenges.

In my view, CSIR needs to create an ""Ease of doing Technology Business""
platform to bring in the right stakeholders, so the technologies reach
the intended beneficiaries.

Recently, CSIR has developed the first Ayurvedic medicine of the country
for diabetic patients. All of you are aware about the potential of this
medicine. Now our goal should be to make people aware of the benefits of
this medicine so that they can make best use of the same.

"i66478","t20160205236734","I feel privileged and honoured to be among sportspersons from our
neighbourhood and brothers and sisters from SAARC countries. I welcome
all of you to India, a country known for its culture of devo bhav and to this beautiful city of Guwahati known for its
hospitality and love for sports.

What moves me today, is your electrifying presence, full of excitement
and enthusiasm for this important international sports event on the banks
of the mighty Brahmaputra.

Guwahati has come a long way since the days of Pragjyotishpur in Ancient
India. It is now a modern and vibrant city and a hub of all economic
activities in the North–Eastern Region of India.

Young people in the North–East and especially here in Assam do not miss
any opportunity to witness a good football match. This fame has spread so
far and wide that the FIFA World Cup Under–17 which will be hosted first
time in India in 2017 has chosen Guwahati as a prime venue for the event.

This sports meet, for me signifies a perfect blend of 3 Ts – Talent,
Teamwork and Togetherness. Among us is the best and most youthful talent
from across South Asia. You are proud members of your team – it can be
your team of the sport you play and a larger team of the nation you are
representing. And, at the same time this meet also celebrates
togetherness of all South Asian nations. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka – no matter which
country we are from, we all call South Asia our home.

Sports has to be an essential part of an individual's life. A good game
is both healthy and refreshing. All round development of the personality
is incomplete without sports. Most importantly, sports brings with it the
most vital sportsman spirit. Without sports, there cannot be any
sportsman spirit. This sportsman spirit will not only help you on the
field but also in other aspects of your life. You will cherish whatever
you learn on the sports field for your entire life. I always say – Jo
Khele, woh Khile. The person who plays, shines.

The mascot of these games 'TIKHOR'represents a baby rhino who is
sharp and intelligent. It captures the spirit of sports persons and young
sport lovers.

The theme song of the games is ""Ei prithivi ekhan krirangan, krira hol
shantir prangan"" sung by legendary late Dr. Bhupen Hazarika.

A singer whose captivating voice left people spellbound; his song
beautifully captures the spirit of South Asian Games, the spirit of
peace, friendship and prosperity.

I have been told by Shri Sarbananda Sonowalji that the Organizing
Committee for the Games has brought waters from each of the eight SAARC
countries and these waters will be merged to signify shared aspirations
and cooperative spirit amongst the SAARC nations.

Dr. Bhupen Hazarika's song “We are in the same boat brother” which
you are going to hear soon is all about SAARC nations. We should join
hands together as a family. Let us kindle this spirit of friendship
through sports in South Asian Games.

My vision for South Asia is the same as my vision for India – Sabka
Saath, Sabka Vikas. All South Asian countries are partners in our journey
towards development.

We the people living in SAARC countries comprise 21 per cent of the
world's population and contribute about 9 per cent to its economy.

As we gather today to commence the 12th South Asian Games, for 23
sporting events covering both men and women, we bring sports–persons from
all SAARC countries to India's North–East and to this great city in a
spirit of friendship, trust and understanding.

I am sure that as the Games proceed, this feeling of friendship trust and
understanding will convert itself not only into sporting opportunities
but also into business and tourism opportunities as well.

Let these Games become a spring board for bringing peace and prosperity
in the region through business, interaction and sporting activities. Let
this be an opportunity for SAARC people to realize their potential.

Sportsmanship is a philosophy of life harmonizing in a balanced whole the
qualities of endurance, will and mind. The challenge for performance, the
joy of effort, the cheer of success, the spirit of friendship and
fairplay in a sports arena speak volumes about how culture, education,
ethics, dignity and society get intertwined with each other during such
sports events.

On the sports field, we can forget what separates us, and we can truly
connect with each other in the spirit of sportsmanship and adventure.

We can celebrate our diversity, and at the same time, be united under
common rules for our sports, and the shared values of honesty and fair
play.

Let us play for peace: let us play for prosperity. Let us play with full
vigour and enthusiasm so that we remember these Games even after they are
over.

The friendships you would form over these 12 days, and the memories you
take back will last you a lifetime.

I am confident that you will cherish these bonds, and become Ambassadors
for peace and friendship between our nations.

While people play for medals and provide tough competition to each other,
I urge the sports–persons and visitors here to take time from their busy
schedules to visit the places of tourism attraction and wonderful
wildlife sanctuaries nearby.

Once again I welcome our friends from SAARC countries. Let the spirit of
'Gurukul' prevail for two weeks in Guwahati as sportspersons share
with each other their best and take back great feeling of warmth and
remarkable experience.

Let the competition be in true sports man spirit. May the best win.

I declare the 12th South Asian Games open.

Thank you.

Greetings!

Shriman Nilesh Vikamse, President, Institute of Chartered Accountants of
India, Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley Ji, my colleagues from the
Council of Ministers, dignitaries from the Chartered Accountants field
who have joined me on live streaming from almost 200 locations
countrywide, the Chief Ministers joining us from respective states, and
the enthusiastic fraternity here braving the Delhi rains. A very warm
welcome to you all!

The achievers being felicitated tonight on this auspicious occasion, all
of you who have assembled here today from various locations, business and
industry stalwarts, fellow citizens, youngsters connected through TV,
radio, Ladies and gentlemen.

Today, we are celebrating the Foundation day of Institute of Charted
Accountant of India (ICAI). My heartfelt wishes to one and all on this
momentous occasion. Serendipity indeed! Your Foundation day and the
commencement of the new economic paradigm of India– the “Goods and
Services Tax” coincide on this very day.

It is indeed a matter of happiness and privilege that I am amidst you on
such a historical day. Let me tell, you have significantly contributed as
Chartered Accountants over the past decades and you all have been given a
solemn right by the government. Its only your fraternity which is
authorized to Certify and Audit the entries in Account books and confirm
whether they are correct or manipulated. The onus of maintaining a sound
economic and financial health of the country rests on you in the same way
as the doctors are concerned about the health of the society and people,
At the same time, I am confident that there wouldn't be a doctor who
would encourage unhealthy practices to make more people fall sick and
enhance his earnings. The doctor is very much aware that if someone is
sick, he can make more money, but he still endorses healthy practices and
habits among the people.

Dear friends, you shoulder the responsibility of ensuring that the
economic and financial system remains healthy and is not plagued by any
malpractices. You are the pillars of a sound Economic and financial
ecosystem of this country, and it is indeed a great honour to be a part
of this conglomerate. In a way it is indeed a great opportunity for me to
learn and share with you today. Chartered Accountants of India have
earned laurels across the globe for their dexterity in Financial Skills.

Today, I got the opportunity to launch the new Chartered Accountancy
Course Curriculum. This is the identity of your Dynamic Course and the
Credibility of Examinations. I am hopeful that this new course will
further consolidate the financial skills of new aspirants joining this
profession. In the wake of globalisation, we have to focus now on
developing dynamic systems so that our institutions are able to produce
dynamic human resources. In order to remain relevant to the industry, we
should design our courses according to the global requirements and
benchmarks. Our courses must integrate technological requirements in the
field of Accountancy. We should encourage innovation in the
Accountant's Field. We should find ways to innovate Charted Nutral
Firms Technology. There is a huge opportunity in the market for new
Software which is required in the field of accountancy.

Friends, our scriptures have laid down four Purusharthas–the objects of
human pursuits. These include– Dharma (righteousness, moral values) Artha
(economic values), Kaama (psychological values), Moksha (spiritual
values). Has it ever occurred to you that whenever we discuss Dharma and
Moksha, it is the saints and monks who cross our minds! In the same way
when one thinks about Accounts and Finance, it is no one else but you who
come first in our minds. It beseems to call you the sages of economic
world. You have the same important role of guiding the economic systems
the way these saints and monks lead us to attain the ultimate truth
Moksha.

It is the moral responsibility of all of you engaged in the profession of
Chartered Accountancy to guide one towards righteous conduct and practice.

My beloved friends,

I deeply appreciate the love and encouragement you all have been
bestowing on me today. I am indebted to you for having allowed me to
share my thoughts with you. We share the same patriotic values and
envision great accomplishments for the nation and its citizens. But, let
us face some harsh realities! These often set you thinking. You might
have heard from the experienced in the society that in case a house is
engulfed in fire and there is complete loss of property, it is said that
the family can get back on its own with its will power and perseverance.
They cope up with the trauma but begin afresh with the same fervour.
Within no time they bounce back. The elderly will say that it is possible
to reinstate the house damaged in fire, but even if one person in the
family is in the habit of stealing and theft, such families can never get
back to their value systems. Even if one family member treads the wrong
path, the family is shattered once and for all.

Dear friends, you are engaged in setting the accounts right If we are
righteous, the country can be salvaged from the biggest of crises. During
the worst of the natural calamities like floods and earthquakes, the
citizens have shown their capabilities to take care of the cause of the
nation while supporting the administration. However, if some of the
citizens of the country are into the habit of stealing and pilferage, it
leads to an irreparable damage to the family and the nation. Dreams are
shattered and it causes road blocks in the development of the nation.
Government has cracked down heavily to nab such pilferers over the past
three years. While new laws have been formulated, older laws have been
made more stringent now. We have MOUs and agreements with several nations
which have been amended accordingly. The latest statistics from Swiss
bank accounts stand a testimony to the strict measures by the government
on the Black Money issue. As reported by the Swiss Bank Authorities, the
black money deposits of Indian Nationals have a hit a record all time
low. Three decades back in 1987, these officials from Swiss Banks had
started declaring how much deposits were being made by nationals of a
country. According to the reports released for the last financial year,
there has been a reduction of 45percent in the deposits made by Indians in the
Swiss banks..

Ever since 2014, the day you all entrusted us with the reins of the
nation, we have put brakes on the trends. You will be shocked and
appalled to know that in 2013 Swiss Banks had reported a 42percent increase in
black money deposits. Ladies and gentlemen, two years later when we shall
start receiving real time data from Switzerland, imagine the plight of
the black money holders. I am sure you do not have such money in your
possession. However, I am sure the love for nation will make you sound
those who have amassed black money.

Friends, while I am endorsing Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. I have also started
the process of cleansing of the economic and financial systems of the
country. I am sure 8th November is ingrained deep in your minds.
Demonetization was a firm and landmark step to wipe out the black money
and corruption from our systems. Let me share with you, I have heard that
since 8th November you all have been immersed in more work like never
before in your careers. I have even heard that the Chartered Accountant
fraternity were on Diwali vacations, hotels had been booked, but some
cancelled their trips and were promptly back to their workstations which
were functional 24x7. Now I am not aware if you all worked righteously or
participated in malpractices! Well, was it in the interest of the nation
or your clients? But you did burn the midnight oil in those days!

Friends, for the first time I would like to share my thoughts on this
drive of eradicating the black money because you all are aware of the
strength of this mission. The government has placed a massive system for
data mining, for the money stocked with the banks, whereby the details of
the transactions of money before and after 8th November have been
extensively studied. We did not interrogate anyone but only analyzed the
data. My dear friends, I have already said that your patriotism is no
less than mine. For the first time I would like to reveal something to
you that would startle the whole country. Whatever data mining has been
done till now has revealed that the transactions of more than 3 lakh
companies – registered companies are under the radar of suspicion.

A lot of data mining is still left; so I really don't know what will be
the actual figure! Some serious things have come to light after this
process began. I am telling you these things with the hope that you might
connect with the thoughts of this government and the strength of the
politicians. On the one hand, the government, the media, the entire
business world were observing closely the night of 30thJune and 1st July
to know what transpires next, on the other hand, 48 hours ago, one lakh
companies were struck off the list by the stroke of a pen. The names of
those companies have been removed from the Registrar of Companies. This
is not an ordinary decision, friends. People who take calculative steps
only through the prism of politics, cannot take such decisions. Only
those who live for the sake of national interest can make such decisions.
The power to eliminate one lakh companies with the stroke of a pen can
come only from the inspiration of patriotism. Those who have looted the
poor will have to return that to the poor.

Apart from this, the government has already identified more than 37
thousand Shell companies who are engaged in hiding black money and hawala
transactions. Stern actions shall be taken against them. More stringent
actions are in store for the companies who will break the law in future.
And I am fully aware of the fact that eliminating fake companies and
taking action against black money can be politically incorrect and pose a
risk to any political party. But someone has to take such tough decisions
for the sake of the country.

My Chartered Accountant friends, I have come here on the occasion of the
Foundation day of your institute. I want to ask you a light question. The
power to keep the account right lies with you. After demonetization,
someone definitely might have helped those companies. These thieves and
robbers must have gone to some economic doctor. I know very well that
those companies might not have come to any of you for this purpose. But
they have definitely taken the help of someone who needs to be
identified. Don't you feel the need to identify such people, who are
sitting among you, who supported these companies? Friends, I have been
told that there are more than two lakh 72 thousand Chartered Accountants
in our country. You also have 'articled assistants' and their number is
also close to two lakhs. And if we add all those chartered accountants
and 'articled assistants' and all your staff then roughly these numbers
will be more than eight lakhs. Your family is more than 8 lakhs in this
field, I mean, in your profession. I would place some more facts for you
since you grasp things quickly from the figures.

It is estimated that there are more than crore engineers and management
graduates in our country. There are more than 8 lakh doctors. These
professions are perceived to be the cream professions or are highly
respectable jobs. There are crores of people in such professions in our
country. Moreover, there are crores of palatial houses built in the
cities of our country. Also, about two crore 18 lakh people had travelled
abroad last year. These figures may astonish you; yet only 32 lakh people
in our country say that their income is more than ten lakhs while filing
tax returns. Can any one of you believe it? I am asking you, the
corrector of the account books. Are there only 32 lakh people in this
country who earn more than 10 lakhs?

This is the bitter truth of our country, my beloved companions. These
numbers show that only 32 lakh people in the country reveal their income
to be more than ten lakh rupees. I believe that most of the people in the
country are salaried class, where people have fixed income and most of
the salary is drawn from the government. Besides this, what is the actual
situation in the country? And so brothers I do not want to project data
further. But by this you will understand that crores of vehicles are
purchased every year in the country. And yet the responsibilities towards
the country are not getting fulfilled; it is a matter of grave concern.

Instead of referring to more data, I want to put my thoughts before you.
CA brothers, a person or a client pays taxes only when the environment
around him is conducive which motivates him to pay the taxes honestly. If
he sees that the advisor himself is asking him to hide the truth then he
will boldly traverse the wrong path. Thus it is equally important to
identify such wrong advisors and take strict actions against them. And
for that you also have to take tough steps. CA is an arrangement in which
Human Resource Development (HR) is done only by you. Curriculum is made
by you only; you conduct the exam; Rules and Regulations are also made by
you, and your institute only punishes the culprits. Now the question
arises that the temple of democracy i. e. the Parliament of India, which
is the voice of 125 crore countrymen, has given you so much authority,
then why is it that in the last 11 years, only 25 Charted Accountants
have been prosecuted. Did only 25 people make a mess? And I have heard
that more than 1400 cases are still pending for many years now. A single
case takes years to settle. Tell me my friends, is it a matter of concern
or not, for such highly Qualified Professionals? Brothers and sisters,
during the freedom struggle, many young people of the country embraced
the gallows. Many great men of the country languished in prisons for the
country's independence and at that time there were many professionals in
the country who came forward and joined the freedom movement. Most of
those professionals were lawyers. These Barristers, in large numbers,
took the cudgel of freedom struggle. They knew the law. They were aware
of the consequences of fighting against the law. Despite this, all the
lawyers of that era who had well flourishing law profession left their
advocacy for this country. Not only Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Dr.
Ambedkar, Jawaharlal Nehru but also Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Pandit Madan
Mohan Malaviya, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Motilal Nehru, C. Rajagopalachari, ,
Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, Saifuddin Kichloo, Bhulabhai Desai,
Lalalajpat Rai , Tej Bahadur Sapru, Asaf Ali, Govind Vallabh Pant,
Kailash Nathkatju uncountable names in the law profession who had laid
their lives for the country. Inspired by patriotism, they dedicated their
lives for the country's independence. Many of them played a decisive role
in framing of our constitution. And brothers and sisters, we cannot
forget that these great men are indispensable part of our country's
history.

Friends, today our country is at another crucial juncture of history.
After the country's political integration in 1947, today the country is
getting economically integrated. Our country is beginning a new journey
this year, 2017, when the dream of 'One Nation, One tax, One market'
has become a reality. On this historic occasion the most important role
is that of the Chartered Accountants. Try to fathom my feelings, friends.
During the freedom movement, the lawyers had placed their lives at stake
for the freedom of India. Today, I am not asking you all to put your
lives at stake. You do not have to go behind the bars. This country is
yours; also the future of this country is your children's. Hence the
reins of leadership of this new era have to be in your hands, just as the
movement for freedom was led by those lawyers. Today the economic
development will be led by the army of my Chartered Accountants. And you
can see that no one but you can make this road to the greater economic
development stronger. I request you again to take your clients to the
path of honesty so as to end corruption. To eliminate corruption, you
have to take the command.

Friends, Chartered Accountants are like ambassadors of any country's
economic system. Your work is like that of an interface between the
government and the tax–paying companies and individuals. Your signature
is more powerful than that of a Prime Minister.

Your signature is a testimony to the trust in the truth. Companies may be
small or big, however, if you certify their books of account then the
government believes in that, people of the country believe in that.

And have you ever thought that once you have signed a balance sheet then
no one questions the balance sheet of that company; files are not held up
after that. Friends, a new chapter begins after that.

Today, I've come here to showcase that new life to you people. If you
certify the account books of a company then the government officers trust
in your assessment. The company grows, it flourishes and you people also
grow, flourish with that. Friends, however, the matter doesn't end
there.

When you people certify the balance sheet of a company and when the
details are placed before general public; when an old person invests his
savings in a mutual fund; a poor widow invests her savings of the entire
month in the share market, if, the correct situation of a company is not
revealed, facts are concealed; and when the real position is exposed then
not only that company sinks, my dear friends, the life of that poor widow
sinks too, that old person's life too is devastated. They invest their
lifetime savings only on the basis of just one signature of yours.

Hence I appeal to you, I appeal to all of you because one–hundred and
twenty–five crore people of India have faith in your signature. Never
ever break their trust, don't let anyone to even doubt that.

If you feel deep down in your hearts that trust has been breached, then
please come forward, please take initiative to restore that trust. The
first of July, the date of your foundation, gives you another opportunity
to restore that faith. I invite you, I have come here to invite you
people to join in this festival to celebrate integrity. Please look at
the importance of your work and then choose your path. You yourself will
realise the pride that the society will have in you.

Friends, there are different definitions for the term 'tax return'.
However, I feel that whatever taxes are collected by a government whether
those taxes have been utilised in the development of the country or not?
This is the 'tax return'.

It plays an important role in curbing inflation. It provides a gas
connection to a lady who has used woods for cooking food all her life.
This fund is used in giving old age pension to those whose children
shirked their responsibility of looking after them.

This money is used in providing self–employment to the youth who works
hard throughout the day so that he can attend evening classes to complete
his education.

This money is being used in providing affordable medicines to those poor
people who don't have money for their treatment, who can't afford to
take a break from their work despite illness lest their children should
go to bed without a meal.

The money collected through taxes is being used for those brave soldiers
who risk their lives on the border to protect us.

This money is being used in providing electricity to those households
that don't have electricity supply even after seventy years of
independence. Not a single bulb was ever illuminated in their homes; they
have been living without electricity.

What could be a greater service than helping the country's poor in
providing what is due to them. You could have never imagined that how
just one signature of yours can help the poor people of this country.

You have huge responsibility in fulfilling the dreams of a common man of
this country; you can play an important role in it. And once you decide
then I'm confident that the 1st of July 2017 will certainly become a
turning point in the history of ICAI.

And, friends, once you take a vow then I can say with confidence that
nobody will try to evade taxes. People only break laws when they know
that there is someone to protect them.

Friends, GST is going to become a medium for you to contribute in nation
building; I urge you to reach out to the people. When I was on the way to
this place, Neelesh told me that you people are going to help the traders
to understand GST. I congratulate him, I offer my gratitude.

You please reach out to the people, enlighten them. Encourage them to
join the mainstream of integrity. In a way, the government has provided a
fresh opportunity to the people in the field of chartered accountancy.
Please prepare yourself for this; I specifically urge the young
professionals in this field.

Please come forward, Chartered Accountants have an extremely important
role in the success and proper implementation of the laws recently passed
by the government, particularly the insolvency and bankruptcy code.

Under this code when a company has been declared bankrupt then its
control will be passed on to an insolvency practitioner. Chartered
accountants can start a new career in this field by becoming insolvency
practitioners. This is a new avenue opened by the government for you
people. However, whichever path you people choose today, in that path,
the term CA should mean Charter and Accuracy, Compliance and Authenticity.

Friends, our country is going to complete 75 years of its independence in
2022. The country has set some targets for the year 2022. New India has
been expecting hard work and industry from all of us.

What kind of India we want to see when it completes 75 years of its
independence as an institute, as a chartered accountant, as an individual
and also as a citizen and play our role, contribute in making the country
like that. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India will complete
75 years of its existence two years after India completes 75 years of its
independence in 2022.

You people should prepare the programme on the occasion of 75 years of
your existence from today itself. You should prepare a roadmap for that
historic occasion from today itself to scale new heights for the
institution and its character. And decide what you will do for the
country, for the future of millions and millions of aspiring youths.

Can't you help in providing a transparent and corruption free system
for the country? What will you say? Will you look at the number of the
people that you saved from paying the taxes? Or will you look at the
number of people that were encouraged by you to lead honest lives by
paying taxes? You will have to decide on this.

You set a target for yourself that how many people you will bring in the
mainstream by honestly paying the taxes. Who can be a better judge than
you yourself to set a target for this task?

Please also think how you can expand the role of technology in your
profession. What could be the role of forensic science in the field of
chartered accountancy, how to use that, how to cater that, if possible
you should also set targets for these things too.

Friends, I have one more expectation from you since you can do it. I fail
to understand why you lag behind. Friends, there are four highly
respected Audit firms in the world and top companies and institutions
entrust these four firms with their audit work. These are called big
four. We are nowhere in these big four. You are capable of it and there
is no dearth of talent either. All of my friends, can you set a target
for yourself if India were to gain respect in the world then when India
will celebrate seventy five years of its independence in 2022, then we
will convert these big four into big eight.

And out of those big eight, four big firms will belong to the people who
are sitting here before me. Friends this is our dream. And it's not
difficult given the reputation and professionalism of our firms.

My friends you people must be respected world over in the field of
chartered accountancy. In the end, I'd like to remind you of an advice
by the most revered economist – Chanakya. He said: “Kalati Kramat Kal
Avam Falam Pivati”, it means the time itself undermines the value of
the success of something if it was not done in the right time. Therefore
don't let your time go in vain.

Arun Ji was talking to you just a while ago; he was saying that India
never had this kind of opportunity before. It is a rare opportunity for
you people as well. Don't let this opportunity go past you.

I've come to invite you to associate yourself with the mainstream of
India's development. Please don't lose sight of the fact this
profession has the capacity to protect, to sustain the entire economy. I
once again convey my best wishes to the entire faculty of the institute,
to all the chartered accountants present here on the occasion of the
foundation day of ICAI.

I also thank the people who are watching this programme through the video
link and also to those chartered accountants of our country who are
watching this programme in other countries.

I express my gratitude to you; I thank all of you with the wish that we
should move forward in a new direction, with a new zeal and with a new
pace to engage the common man of this country in a celebration of
honesty. Many thanks my friends, many thanks.","pms","modi","2017","201707","20170701","pmo","firstterm","nda2","nationalpol","speech","other","other","other","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hindiother","xxxxx","httppibnicinnewsiteprintreleaseaspxrelid167079","nmo2017","4825","4825","notrans","collective","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","modi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","nmo_spe","na","yes","others","m","bjp","nmo_nt","nmo_nda2","bjp_spe","bjp_nt","bjp_nda2","m_spe","m_nt","m_nda2","pms2017","pms_spe","pms_nt","pms_nda2","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_p1_nt","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_p1_nt","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_p1_nt","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_p1_nt","modi_spe","modi_spe","modi_spe","modi_nt","modi_nt","modi_nt","modi_nda2","modi_nda2","modi_nda2","nmo","nmo","nmo","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiother","pms","nmo","nt","spe","f","bjp_nmo","bjp_spe","bjp_nda2","bjp_nt","lib_nmo","lib_spe","lib_nda2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2017","lib_bjp_spe","nmo_spe_2017","nmo_nt_2017","bjp_spe_2017","bjp_nt_2017","other","o201707","nmo_spe_201707","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_nt","pms_spe","pms_nt","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","Ms","Ms","Ms","Ms",NA,NA,NA,4481
"i81664","t20191118487449","Namaskar Friends, this is the last session of 2019, and it is also a very important session. Because this is the 250th session of the Rajya Sabha. The 250th session of Rajya Sabha is beginning with very inspiring memories of its journey of 250 sessions. Similarly, on the 26th of this session we have our Constitution Day. While our Constitution is celebrating 70 years, this constitution encompasses the unity, integrity, diversity of India, beauty of India and is the driving force for the country.


So 70 years of the constitution itself, through this house, can become an opportunity for the countrymen to awaken. In the past, there has been an opportunity to meet almost all the leaders of the party and this session also like the last time due to the active positive role of everyone, due to the cooperation of all the parties after the formation of the new government, the cooperation of all the honorable MPs. The session was filled with unprecedented achievements.


And this I should publicly say proudly that this achievement does not belong to the government, it does not belong to the Treasury Bench, this achievement belongs to the entire House and all MPs are entitled to it and that's why I once again positively active I express my gratitude to all the MPs for the role, and I hope that this session will also help in speeding up the journey of development of the country, in the country, with the rapid progress in the world. We should also show the strength of steps to our Parliament. We want open discussion on all issues, it is necessary to have the best debate.

Be it a dispute, a dispute, a dialogue, everyone uses their intelligence power in plenty. And contribute to enriching the discussion of the House and the nectar that comes out of it is useful for the bright future of the country. So thank you very much to all these MPs as well.","pms","modi","2019","201911","20191118","pmo","secondterm","nda3","nationalpol","speech","other","other","other","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hindiother","governmentisopentodiscussallissuesinparliamentpm","httpswwwnarendramodiintextofpmsstatementtomediaaheadofwintersessionofparliament","nmo2019","212","5595","gt","saksham","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","modi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","nmo_spe","na","yes","others","m","bjp","nmo_nt","nmo_nda3","bjp_spe","bjp_nt","bjp_nda3","m_spe","m_nt","m_nda3","pms2019","pms_spe","pms_nt","pms_nda3","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p2_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_p2_nt","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p2_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_p2_nt","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p2_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_p2_nt","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p2_spe","nmo_da_nt","nmo_nat_nt","nmo_p2_nt","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nda3","nmo_nda3","nmo_nda3","nmo","nmo","nmo","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nda3","nmo_nda3","nmo_nda3","mint","clean","lib","hindiother","pmsgt","nmo","nt","spe","s","bjp_nmo","bjp_spe","bjp_nda3","bjp_nt","lib_nmo","lib_spe","lib_nda3","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2019","lib_bjp_spe","nmo_spe_2019","nmo_nt_2019","bjp_spe_2019","bjp_nt_2019","other","o201911","nmo_spe_201911","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_nt","pms_spe","pms_nt","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","Ms","Ms","Ms","Ms",NA,NA,NA,330
"i63616","t20150415587307","Respected Prime Minister.

The spiritual activities manifested through Taichi in tandem with body
balancing activities and on the other hand exemplification from Yoga…..

I greet the Prime Minister for the conceptualization of this programme. I
also greet  him for the choice of this venue, for this is the Temple of
Heaven and to attain heaven there has to be a balance between mind, body
and intellect. The place may be in China or in India, we will have to
look for points of cultural unity and strengthen the bond of unity
between the two nations. This will then help realize the dream of heaven
for the mankind.

Yoga is the art of striking a balance between the mind, body and
intellect. Today, the world is passing through mental stress and
frustration has become the defining word for each generation. It is a
matter of concern for each and every corner of the world and the way to
freedom from this menace is Yoga. Last September when I placed the
proposal for International Yoga Day before the United Nations, 177
nations co–sponsored it. China too became a co–sponsor along with India.
This resolution has got support from maximum number of countries in the
history of UN and was passed in the shortest span of time. Now the entire
world will celebrate International Yoga Day on 21st June.

This is such an amazing coincidence that on the foregrounds of the Temple
of Heaven, children of Chinese origin are doing Yoga and Children of
Indian origin are performing Tai–chi. This is unique opportunity in
itself for us to bind our cultural heritage. We have to take this
forward. Yoga liberates us from disease and Yoga liberates us from
desires. For the human heart struggling in these times of crises, be it
any part of the world, Yoga and tai–chi can act as a new life force for
it.

The entire world will understand Yoga in its true spirit on June 21st and
it will help achieve the kind of holistic care required worldwide today.

I would like to thank the Prime Minister once again from the depths of my
heart for the arrangement of this programme.

"i66772","t20160312665281","All the respected people!

Nitish Ji has already called the name of everyone in detail! Hence, I'm
not repeating them. But, I respectfully welcome all of them.

This is the closing ceremony of Centenary celebrations of the Patna High
Court. In a way, this is the beginning of new responsibilities for a new
century. Therefore, in the last century, which newer heights of success
this High Court has achieved, which tradition created a feeling of trust
in the mindset of common people, compliance to which work culture
awakened the hopes in the society, it is the responsibility of all of us,
to carry them forward in their best aspects and lay a strong foundation
in the new century of Patna High Court.

As strong the foundation of coming century would be laid by us, same
trust of the common man will be deepened in our systems and democracy in
the country. And hence, apart from being a ceremony to celebrate, this
occasion is also meant for making new resolves and commitments. Today,
when the centenary year has come to its end, I hope the Bar and the Bench
will work towards setting new benchmarks. I believe that the system which
has a century of precious heritage can surely render a lot to take the
country forward. I have full faith on you that Patna High court bar,
which has given us so many great personalities and so many dignitaries,
will keep maintaining its glorious tradition in time to come.

Sometimes, I feel that there are just a few places in our country, where
people pay attention about celebrating the golden or centenary jubilee of
their institutions. While I was Gujarat CM, I visited a village school
where literacy level was still very low hardly at 30–32 per cent. I was
surprised to see at the school building, which was about 120 years old.
It means the village where school was evolved 120 years back, the
education level is stalled at only 30–32percent. This kind of situation puts
forth a challenge before us that if the systems evolved, are not soulful,
dynamic and progressive; we will not be able to keep pace with changing
time and fulfil the aspirations of the time. That's why, the biggest
challenge before us is how to energize our systems, how to keep them
alive. Sometimes, the evolution of system is not tough, but it demands a
great vigour and long time struggle to revitalize the existing systems.
And therefore let us utilize our 100 years long vast experience in this
direction.

I have to suggest an idea I just thought about sitting here. Can our
courts bring out a bulletin every year which highlights the oldest cases
pending before them? Some cases may be 40 years or 50 years old and it
could create sensitivity on the pendency of cases. It would also spark a
discussion in the society, among people sitting in Bar and would inspire
them to come out of this problem. This could help create an atmosphere
for the courts, for the judges and for the lawyers to get motivated for
devising the result–oriented work plans to tackle the pending cases.

And it is not a strenuous task. It is also not wrong to do so. Suppose,
during this step, the name of a 50 year old case reappears, and then it
would not be worrisome for currently working people, as all the people
responsible toward it must have been retired. However, it would be
beneficial for us in creating a psychological environment to come out
through the concerns for the pendency of cases.

Today's generation is fortunate enough to have something that bar
members of old generations did not have earlier – the power of
technology. Earlier, while fighting litigation, a lot of time was spent
on carrying out research and search out old references. But, today Google
is such kind of bar member, that now it searches anything you want just
within a click of mouse. And by easily quoting perfect judgment, you can
make your point accepted. As much techno–savvy can we make the bar, the
bench and the courts by injecting digital technology in their systems
that can bring a radical change in improving the quality of arguments,
quality of judgments as well as space of the judgement. Let us make our
efforts in that direction.

If we look at the freedom movement of India, we have to accept that it
was led majorly by our advocates, by our barristers. How can we fight
against the British rule using our wisdom and legal system, this example
was set by the bars and barristers of this country. In this way, these
legal professionals have made a great contribution to the independence
movement of India.

Even after that, whenever India has faced critical times, attacks on its
fundamental values, it was the bar, who most of the time raised its voice
against it, it was our courts, who made endeavours to reinvigorate it.
Hence, in a democratic country like India full of multiple diversities,
if we aspire to keep our society and country united, then is the need of
the hour to launch a movement with active efforts, which bridge the
differences in the society and play a role in unifying it. If this
movement is run through the bars, we can bring a revolutionary change in
our country.

I would like to share an incident, which has been immensely
heart–touching to me and which reflects how sometimes a change can be
brought in the Intuit democratic values even after a long time.

Recently, during my UK visit, British Prime Minister as a gift returned
me the membership of a noted lawyer. The history of this bar membership
revolves around Indian freedom struggle. There were two ideologies
existing during our freedom movement, one committed toward non–violence
and another relying upon armed revolution. Revolutionary master for those
believing in armed revolution was Shyamji Krishna Varma, who passed away
in 1930. He fought the battle of India's independence from the land of
London sitting under the nose of Englishmen. He inspired a large numbers
of revolutionaries including Madan Lal Dhingra to sacrifice their lives
for Mother India. And for that reason, his membership was stripped of by
British bar.

During my visit to that British bar, the bar members officially reviewed
this century old case after about 1920 and with honour returned me that
membership. I am narrating this incident to you, as after a century, any
relative of Shyamji Krishna Varma is not present there, despite that the
people connected with judicial system had a resolve to change this
situation and they did it by taking initiative. Whenever PM of India
visits, he is fortunately returned with such kinds of memorable incidents.

It is the global perception towards the commitment of Indians towards
their values. Let us move forward assimilating these values in our lives.

Today, this closing ceremony of centenary celebrations is also the
auspicious beginning of a new century, and for that I convey my lots of
best wishes to you.

The country will surely keep receiving a rich heritage on behalf of you,
with this expectation thank you very much!

"i68349","t20160826773860","His Excellency Shri Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister of
Singapore
My Fellow Ministers,
Chief Ministers,
Invited speakers and friends,

There was a time when development was believed to depend on the quantity
of capital and labour. Today we know that it depends as much on the
quality of institutions and ideas. Early last year, a new institution was
created, namely, the National Institution for Transforming India or NITI.
NITI was created as an evidence based think tank to guide India's
transformation.

One of NITI's functions is:

– to mainstream external ideas into Government policies, through
collaboration with national and international experts;

– to be the Government's link to the outside world, outside experts and
practitioners;

– to be the instrument through which ideas from outside are incorporated
into policy–making.

The Government of India and the State Governments have a long
administrative tradition. This tradition combines indigenous and external
ideas from India's past. This administrative tradition has served India
well in many ways. Above all, it has preserved democracy and federalism,
unity and integrity, in a country of glorious diversity. These are not
small achievements. Yet, we now live in an age where change is constant
and we are variables.

We must change for both external and internal reasons. Each country has
its own experiences, its own resources and its own strengths. Thirty
years ago, a country might have been able to look inward and find its own
solutions. Today, countries are inter dependent and inter connected. No
country can afford any longer to develop in isolation. Every country has
to benchmark its activities to global standards, or else fall behind.

Change is also necessary for internal reasons. The younger generation in
our own country is thinking and aspiring so differently, that government
can no longer afford to remain rooted in the past. Even in families, the
relationship between the young and old has changed. There was a time when
elders in a family knew more than those who were younger. Today, with the
spread of new technology, the situation is often reversed. This increases
the challenge for government in communicating and in meeting rising
expectations.

If India is to meet the challenge of change, mere incremental progress is
not enough. A metamorphosis is needed.

That is why my vision for India is rapid transformation, not gradual
evolution.

The transformation of India cannot happen without a transformation of
governance.

A transformation of governance cannot happen without a transformation
in mindset.

A transformation in mindset cannot happen without transformative
ideas.

We have to change laws, eliminate unnecessary procedures, speed up
processes and adopt technology. We cannot march through the twenty first
century with the administrative systems of the nineteenth century.

Fundamental changes in administrative mindsets usually occur through
sudden shocks or crisis. India is fortunate to be a stable democratic
polity. In the absence of such shocks, we have to make special efforts to
force ourselves to make transformative changes. As individuals, we may
absorb new ideas by reading books or articles. Books open the windows of
our minds. However, unless we brainstorm collectively, ideas remain
confined to individual minds. We often hear of new ideas and understand
them. But we do not act upon them, because it is beyond our individual
capacity. If we sit together, we will have the collective force to
convert ideas into action. What we need is a collective opening of our
minds, to let in new, global perspectives. To do this, we have to absorb
new ideas collectively rather than individually. It requires a concerted
effort.

As many of you know, ever since taking office, I have personally
participated in structured brainstorming sessions with bankers, with
police officers and with Secretaries to Government, among others. The
ideas coming from those sessions are being incorporated into policy.

These efforts have been to tap ideas from inside. The next step is to
bring in ideas from outside. Culturally, Indians have always been
receptive to ideas from elsewhere. It is said in the Rigveda – “aa no bhadraah kratavo yantu vishvatah”, which means, let us welcome noble thoughts
flowing in from all directions.

This is the purpose of the Transforming India Lecture Series. It is a
series which we will attend, not as individuals but as part of a team who
can collectively make change happen.

We will draw the best from the wisdom and knowledge of eminent persons,
who changed, or influenced change in the lives of many, to make their
nation a better place in the planet.

This lecture will be the first in a series. You have all been given a
feedback form. I look forward to your detailed and frank feedback to help
us improve this process. I request you to suggest names of experts and
panelists from inside and outside India. I also request all Secretaries
to Government to conduct a follow up discussion in a week's time, with
the participants from their Ministries. The purpose is to convert ideas
that emerge in today's session into specific action points relevant to
each group. Wherever possible, I request the Ministers also to
participate in these sessions.

One of the greatest reformers and administrators of our time was Lee Kuan
Yew, who transformed Singapore to what it is today. It is therefore
fitting that we are inaugurating this series with Shri Tharman
Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore. He is a prolific
scholar and public policy maker. Apart from being Deputy Prime Minister,
he is also the Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies,
Minister of Finance and Chairman of Monetary Authority of Singapore. In
the past, he has served as the Minister of Manpower, Second Minister of
Finance and Minister of Education.

Shri Shanmugaratnam was born in Nineteen Fifty Seven and is of Sri Lankan
Tamil ancestry. He earned his Bachelor's degree in Economics at the
London School of Economics. He has a Master's degree in Economics from
Cambridge University. He has another Master's degree in Public
Administration from Harvard University. At Harvard, he was honoured with
the Littauer Fellow award for his outstanding performance.

Shri Shanmugaratnam is one of the world's leading intellectuals. I
would like to give you an example of the range and sweep of his ideas.
Today, Singapore's economy depends a lot on transshipment. But if
global warming melts the polar ice caps, new navigation routes may open
and possibly reduce Singapore's relevance. I am told he has already
started thinking about this possibility and planning for it.

Friends. The list of achievements and honours received by Shri
Shanmugaratnam is long. But we are all eager to listen to him. Therefore,
without further delay, it is with great pleasure that I welcome Shri
Tharman Shanmugaratnam to this stage and request him to enlighten us on
the subject of India in the Global Economy.

"i54956","t20100520794079","Dear Sisters and Brothers,

You shall no doubt have understood the context alluded to in the previous line. The famous Chicago address of 1893, the event which marked the arrival of Swami Vivekananda in America, was opened with a very similar line, and what an opening it was. I do not refer to the applause that the line got, but rather the sentiment associated with the line. In five words, Swamiji had managed to encapsulate the essence of our country, our openness, be it in terms of openness of thought or openness in terms of lending a welcoming hand to others. Our country has always prided itself on its capability to provide not just a shelter, but rather a home to other people and other disciplines. And this has been made possible only through pure love, trust and a general sense of concern for others.

We are here now to discuss and understand how we can commemorate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Swami Vivekananda. I welcome the setting up of this committee, and I thank you all for inviting me to this meeting to share my ideas. However, since we are talking about none other than Swamiji himself, the biggest way in which we can commemorate his 150th birth anniversary, the greatest homage we can pay to this great man would be by implementing some of his ideas for social reform, and see that they get implemented correctly the way he would have liked it.

When we talk about Swami Vivekananda we are not just talking about a monk, we are in fact talking about one of the greatest intellectuals and champions of social justice the world had ever seen, a person who was born much before his time and sowed the seeds of the future in his present. When we talk about Swami Vivekananda, we are not merely restricting ourselves to a religion; we are in fact talking about humankind as a whole, a land free of caste, creed and colour. When we talk about Swami Vivekananda, we are not merely talking about ideas for the betterment of people, we are talking about the implementation of those ideas, down to the grassroots, down to the lowest levels, for if change has to begin, it has to begin from the people who need it the most.

In his lifetime Swamiji tried to bring about many changes in society and the irony is that while we are here discussing how to commemorate 150 years of his birth most of the evils that plagued society then still affect our society. In this context Swamiji's teachings hold as much relevance today as they held a hundred years earlier. He realized that there was more to the world than 'Me, Myself and I'. He understood that there was a common soul running through all of nature, a common tie that binds us all, and he believed in his strand of Vedanta which held that no one can be truly free until everyone is free. At a base level, this can be categorized as the spirit of greater good. However this is not merely good for others. This is about freedom for everyone, including the self. In today's world, which reeks of corruption, selfishness and putting the self above the rest, the philosophy of impersonal enlightenment taught by Swami Vivekananda can be an antidote. He said that that the individual cannot be free unless everyone is, and that puts a collective responsibility on all of us to strive for a better world.

Swamiji's ideas are not mere idle philosophies. We must remember that he was the man who gave us the gift of ""Practical Vedanta"". His entire philosophy revolved around the concept of social justice and his idea of service was service to the Daridra Narayans, the outcastes. His mission was to serve the suffering, and he saw to it that this happened. He mobilized the Ramakrishna Math as well as the Ramakrishna Mission, and brought about an organized movement to reduce the suffering of the masses through educational, cultural, medical and humanitarian relief work. This sort of holistic approach to ameliorate society is something we can derive inspiration from, for it is not merely the open wound that has to heal, it is the scabs left on the mind that are not reopened. Swamiji spoke of bringing about a radical transformation that would change the very social fabric of this country, a revolution that would lead to the awakening of a nation, and bring about social justice for all. Putting this cause in his own words, he said:

 ""My whole ambition in life is to set in motion a machinery which will bring noble ideas to the door of everybody""

However, given the limited time that he spent on earth, one cannot be sure if such machinery had indeed been put in place. And hence it is up to us. We, as political leaders, as heads of state governments and the government of India, can make this change happen in its true sense, throughout the land. If one man could do so much in such a short span of time to alleviate the suffering of so many, should we not try to honour this achievement and the man himself by trying our best to bring about this change? Given that people are still suffering, poverty is still rampant, and division on the basis of caste and creed still common, is it not our duty to realize this dream of creating a system that will help to alleviate and gradually eradicate this suffering and pain?

We, the people of India, have tried to provide as much education to as many people as possible and it truly is our duty to do so. However, as Swamiji had put it, education is not a means of imparting knowledge from the outside; rather it is the manifestation of the perfection already within human beings. Education does not end with school or college, or with textbooks; education is a lifelong process, and we will do well to keep learning to the very last moment of our lives. The world itself is a huge book, and it is up to us to read the pages that are presented before our eyes, to learn from our everyday experiences and then try to apply this learning for the betterment of society. As Swami Prabhananda pointed out, Swami Vivekananda's concept of education consisted of Capacity, Propensity and Capability: that which makes learning possible, the development of learning, and self–development or self–empowerment. In the words of Swamiji himself:

""The education which does not help the common mass of people to equip themselves for the struggle of life, which does not bring out strength of character, a spirit of philanthropy, and the courage of a lion – is it worth the name? Real education is that which enables one to stand on one's own legs""

In the light of these words, it is up to us to ponder: is the education that is being imparted to our children in accordance with the real sense of the term? And if it is not, then how can such a change in the education system be brought about to make education more relevant and pertinent in a rapidly changing world? And this is not a new question which I am putting forth before you; today I am merely re–iterating the question which had been asked over a hundred years ago.

In order to bring about true and meaningful changes in the pages of our times, we not only have to look at it in the short run and the changes we might bring about with immediate effect, we also have to seriously consider some long–term programs to mobilize the vision of Swami Vivekananda and convert his dream of an emancipated India into tangible reality. While the proposals themselves deal with short–term awareness creation activities meant to introduce a large mass of people, especially the youth, to the teachings of Swami Vivekananda, there is a real need to create permanent institutions which can take on the baton and provide a sense of continuity to the interests kindled by the IEC activities. For a man who believed actions speak more louder than words the least we can do to honour him is to provide some sort of a permanent platform to keep his message alive for the present as well as for generations to come.

Today, the average age of our countrymen is around 25 years. It is heartening to see that the future of the country lies in such young hands, and we should do all that we can to provide facilities for the betterment of these youth. The first thing we have to do is to make our youth strong both in mind and body. And for this, we need not look westwards for inspiration. All we have to do is a bit of soul–searching. We should remember that we were the ones who gave the West the gift of Yoga, which aims at attaining the body–mind continuum. While people pour in from the West into our land to learn this ancient and beneficial art, we, the creators of this form are well on our way to forgetting it. It is time we used our own nectar for our own benefit. It is time that we look beyond fads and fleeting trends and recognize the value of our own heritage. It is time that we brought back this ancient system, and make it available to the masses and especially the youth in a scientific, systematic and widespread manner.

As I have mentioned earlier, Swamiji was a great advocate of the adoption of Yoga, as it not only strengthens the body but also helps in giving us better control over our minds. He was responsible for popularizing all four folds of Yoga – Gyan, Bhakti, Raj and Karma. In accordance with his belief Yoga should be promoted in a big way in India reaching out to the masses and not just be restricted to the elite. Gujarat has already made Yoga compulsory for all children in schools from the first to the ninth standard. To make Yoga a nationwide phenomenon, the Government of India can announce that Yoga should be taught compulsorily in all schools of India from the year 2013, which marks Swamiji's 150th birth anniversary. The creation of four Yoga Universities in the name of Swami Vivekananda for research and practice would be a fitting tribute to this great man's vision, and it is up to us to realize and maintain this vision. Apart from these, in the future, the Yoga universities should have branches all over the globe, as this creates a better touch–point for imparting the teachings of Swamiji to a greater audience. Yoga itself can also be propagated as a sort of stress management system, to create more awareness about the benefits of this art form, and increase its desirability across the world. Great universities and centres of excellence, such as Nalanda and Takshashila, existed on this land, and these Yoga Universities should follow suit and become leading lights in their field, making a name for themselves on the global educational map.

As for the serious practitioners of Yoga, they should be incentivized to look at Yoga as a form of employment, with post graduate qualification in Yoga being recognised for recruitment of PT teachers in schools. Finally, in order to set standards in the practice of Yoga, the Government can set up a regulatory body in the country for standardization of Yoga Techniques and for accreditation of Yoga Institutes in the country. The practice of Yoga itself should also be rewarded with awards such as the Best Yoga Practitioner award in order to incentivise the practice of Yoga. With all these measures in place, I firmly believe that India can become the Yoga capital of the world, and all the wealth of knowledge that we posses in this field will turn out to be India's USP, in turn attracting even more global attention and fanfare.

Furthermore, it is shocking, and in a way appalling, that there exists no educational institution or university devoted to the study of Swamiji's teaching. Given the fact that we are talking about a man who was far ahead of his time and whose teachings are still relevant, we should set up a centre of excellence in one of our universities to deal exclusively with the study of Swami Vivekananda's teachings and their relevance to our everyday lives. If such a centre is set up in Gujarat, I am willing to provide land and infrastructure to further this noble cause. This centre of excellence can study his teachings and their application in varied fields such as education, management, and human resource development.

The major point of difference between Swami Vivekananda and other monks, gurus and spiritual leaders is that according to Swamiji, God was not the centre of religion, Man was. And it was only through the service of man and mankind that one could attain the sublime heights of spirituality. For the realization of this dream, Swamiji saw tremendous potential in the youth, whose energies could be harnessed and channelized in the right direction for the welfare of all. He saw through the fact that it was mainly the youth of the country who had the power to transform and convince other youth, having a sort of multiplier effect on the state of affairs and bringing about quick and effective change. India is a young country, with tremendous potential in terms of manpower. However, in today's world, we see the youth living in a hyper real world of constant excitement. In this era of globalization, in this world of infinite choices, it is necessary to channelize this abundant energy of the youth, and we now have the opportunity to provide the youth the right direction so that they can take their country to greater heights.

Swamiji gave us the concept of ""Daridra Narayan Seva"" – the service of God through the service of the poor. This was meant to liberate not only individuals but also the entire society as a whole. Sadly, in today's world, we find the youth constantly being bombarded and stifled with the message of individual glory and success. Today's world compels them to be self–centred and inward looking rather than doing something for the common good of society. It is important for us to remember the words of wisdom that have been passed on to us over the years, and not forget them in our quest to reach for the stars. Hence it would be in the fitness of things to start a poverty alleviation program in Swamiji's name or to rename an existing program to spread the message of Daridra Narayan Seva. Swamiji had said: ""India wants the sacrifice of at least a thousand of her young men"" when he pledged himself to the cause of serving the poor. Today, we need more than just thousand people to achieve the goal set by Swamiji. A special program can be implemented, which involves the educated youth of our country, and requires them to work for a year or two, devoting their time to rural upliftment and service to the poor. In doing this, they can realize the philosophy of spiritual humanism that formed the core of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda. One should remember what Swami Vivekananda said with regard to the proper use of the body carefully cultivated through Yoga;

 ""Let this body go in service of others.""

In order to protect and preserve the memory of Swami Vivekananda and his teachings, we can create memorials in his honour. All places where Swamiji stayed for a period of more than a week in the entire country during his journey across the nation can have memorials erected in the name of Swamiji. Four places in Gujarat: Rajkot, Vadodara, Limbdi and Porbandar: have already established such memorials. Apart from these spots, a statue of Swamiji can be erected at Somnath, which was the first place in his itinerary when he set forth on his Bharat Yatra. These memorials, apart from being a homage to the great man, will also serve as a permanent reminder of who the Swamiji was, and what he stood for.

It is imperative that we get the message of Swamiji across to as many people possible across the nation. To meet this end, we can broadcast the teachings of Swamiji in television and radio, or depict an episode pertaining to teachings. This ""Vivek Vani"" program has to be done on a daily basis to increase the reach as well as the frequency of users across these mediums, and also to create a greater impact on the people tuning in to these programs.

The essence of Swami Vivekananda should be kept alive not by mere words, but by actions. To this effect, places where Swamiji lived and taught such as Kolkata, Kanyakumari, Somnath, Porbandar, Kutch etc. should be developed as part of the ""Vivekananda Tourist Circuit and Education Sphere"", and necessary facilities should be provided to enable people to visit the places where Swami Vivekananda lived and taught.

Efforts should be made to propagate Swami Vivekananda as a role model for the youth of today, as Swamiji's main concern was to mobilise the youth of the country to join the movement. Also, given the fact that Swami Vivekananda achieved all that he had to at a very young age, and also chose to be different from the rest around him, it might strike a chord with the youth of today. To achieve this aim, the Government of India can institute awards for ""Ideal Youth Personality of the Year"" in the name of Swami Vivekananda. Apart from this, the recently introduced Model School Scheme of the Government of India can be named after Swamiji. Also, in order to strike a patriotic chord with the youth, the National Service Scheme, which is a Government of India Scheme, can be named after him, considering he was in favour of doing service to the country.

The works of Swami Vivekananda should be disseminated and distributed to as large an audience as possible. Swamiji's works are currently available in print only in English and a few other languages. For greater understanding of Swamiji and his efforts, the complete works of Swami Vivekananda should be made available in other Indian as well as foreign languages, and they should be made affordable at a reasonable price after their translation. Apart from the print medium, the film based on Swami Vivekananda should also be dubbed in foreign languages to extend the reach and impact of Swamiji's teachings across the globe.

Swamiji's works and ideas cannot be restricted to the shores of one land alone, and it is important that we create a sort of global consciousness about the Swamiji's teachings and ideas. To make this happen, we can enlist the help of our Indian embassies across the globe. Committees can be formed, which will consist of local leaders who will take it upon themselves to spread the word of Swamiji. Initiatives such as conversion of Swamiji's works into the language of the land, and holding seminars and conferences related to Swamiji and his teachings can be organized to effectively bring about an increased interest in Swami Vivekananda in foreign shores.

Swami Vivekananda paid a great deal of emphasis on education and self–reliance through education. To reward this spirit of self–reliance through education, the Central Government should institute fellowships for excellence in higher education and research to such scientists and researchers who have with their critical research and contributions, made India self–reliant.

Apart from these measures, Swamiji was also a passionate advocate of women's rights and women's equality. He had said:

""It is very difficult to understand why in this country(India) so much difference is made between men and women, whereas the Vedanta declares that one and the same conscious Self is present in all beings. You always criticize the women, but say what you have dome for their upliftment? Writing down Smritis etc., and binding them by hard rules, the men have turned women into manufacturing machines! If you do not raise the women, who are the living embodiment of the Divine Mother, don't think that you have any other way to rise.""

Following this strain of thought, it is time for us to act upon these words and do something concrete for the women of our country. The empowerment envisaged by Swamiji can be realized only through education of women. In this context, the Government of India should set up scholarships schemes named after Swami Vivekananda to encourage the education of girl children. Such a measure will increase the enrolment of girls into schools, and also provide families an incentive to raise their girl child in the best possible manner. As for the results, this will not only create awareness about the Swamiji himself, but also attach his name with the cause that he felt so deeply and passionately about.

What sort of human being did Swamiji envisage? His poem to Miss Alberta Sturges captures this wonderfully:

The Mother's heart, the hero's will,

The softest flowers' sweetest feel;

The charm and force that ever sway

The altar–fire's flaming play;

The strength that leads, in love obeys;

Far–reaching dreams, and patient ways,

Eternal faith in Self, in all,

The light Divine in great, in small;

All these and more than I could see

It is my appeal to all of you that if we are to commemorate the 150th Birth Anniversary of this great man, we should do it with deeds and not words to usher in a better tomorrow. We can indeed do a lot. We can make a real difference. We have the voice to bring about a change. Let us honour this great man by trying to realize his dream of a better India, a brighter India, by following in his footsteps. The concept of Daridra Narayan Seva holds as true today as it did then with community service paving the way for the greater good of mankind. The art of Yoga can lead to the general well–being of both the mind and the body and with India at the forefront of this movement can garner global recognition and acclaim. Projection of Swami Vivekananda as a youth icon will lead to more social consciousness in the youth of today. The dissemination of the works of Swamiji will lead to greater awareness about the life, times and efforts of this great man towards ameliorating the poor plight of our countrymen. All in all the commemoration of the 150th birth anniversary should be a reason for all of us to rise to the occasion in our own small ways, to take a step forward in the right direction. In Swamiji's words, it is time for us to ""Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.""","pms","modi","2010","201005","20100520","gujaratcm","prefirstterm","upa2","nationalpol","speech","other","other","other","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","na","nationalcommittee150anniversaryswamivivekanand","httpwwwnarendramodiinsuggestionsmadeatthefirstmeetingofnationalcommitteeforcelebrating150thbirthanniversaryofswamivivekananda2678","nmo2010","3551","3551","notrans","collective","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","modi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","nmo_spe","na","yes","others","m","bjp","nmo_nt","nmo_upa2","bjp_spe","bjp_nt","bjp_upa2","m_spe","m_nt","m_upa2","pms2010","pms_spe","pms_nt","pms_upa2","nmo_pa","nmo_reg","nmo_gc","nmo_pa_spe","nmo_reg_spe","nmo_gc_spe","nmo_pa_nt","nmo_reg_nt","nmo_gc_nt","nmo_pa","nmo_reg","nmo_gc","nmo_pa_spe","nmo_reg_spe","nmo_gc_spe","nmo_pa_nt","nmo_reg_nt","nmo_gc_nt","nmo_pa","nmo_reg","nmo_gc","nmo_pa_spe","nmo_reg_spe","nmo_gc_spe","nmo_pa_nt","nmo_reg_nt","nmo_gc_nt","nmo_pa","nmo_reg","nmo_gc","nmo_pa_spe","nmo_reg_spe","nmo_gc_spe","nmo_pa_nt","nmo_reg_nt","nmo_gc_nt","modi_spe","modi_spe","modi_spe","modi_nt","modi_nt","modi_nt","modi_upa2","modi_upa2","modi_upa2","nmo","nmo","nmo","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_nt","nmo_upa2","nmo_upa2","nmo_upa2","mint","clean","lib","na","pms","nmo","nt","spe","p","bjp_nmo","bjp_spe","bjp_upa2","bjp_nt","lib_nmo","lib_spe","lib_upa2","lib_nt","lib_bjp","lib2010","lib_bjp_spe","nmo_spe_2010","nmo_nt_2010","bjp_spe_2010","bjp_nt_2010","other","o201005","nmo_spe_201005","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_nt","pms_spe","pms_nt","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","Ms","Ms","Ms","Ms",NA,NA,NA,3868

"i67251","t20160511182218","President of Maldives Mr. Abdulla Yameen ji and my friends from media,

It is an important day in the history of cooperation between India and
Maldives.

I warmly welcome you on your visit to India. Your presence in Delhi is a
matter of immense pleasure to me in a personal way. Your arrival makes me
feel that one of my friends has come to meet me.

Maldives has been one of the closest partners of India. Ancient cultural
relations, people–to–people ties and the waves of Indian Ocean connect
both of our countries together.

Excellency Yameen,

The progress, security and economic growth of Maldives are as much as
your aims so much of India. The stability and security of the Maldives is
directly linked with the strategic interests of the India.

The concerns of the Maldives are ours too.

It is my belief that economic development of India is incomplete without
the growth of our neighbour countries.

'Neighbours First' is not just our policy, but the significant part
of our principles.

Friends,

I and President Yameen and I have held detailed discussions on all the
topics pertaining to bilateral relations. It is apparently clear that the
contour of the ties between India and Maldives is defined by our shared
strategic, security, economic and development goals. We are conscious of
the security needs of Maldives.

President Yameen too has agreed that Maldives will be fully sensitive to
strategic and security interests of India.

We share the view that our deep friendship is the best and single medium
to ensure coastline security of India and Maldives. This is also
absolutely essential for the peace, prosperity and security in entire
Indian Ocean Region.

India understands its role very well as a net security provider in the
Indian Ocean Region and is fully ready to protect its strategic interests
in this part of the globe.

We have formed agreement on many important issues in today's discussion.

The prompt implementation of a concrete action plan in the defence sector
will further strengthen our security cooperation,

Development of ports, continuous training, capacity building, supply of
necessary equipment and maritime surveillance would be the main elements
of security cooperation.

India and Maldives will join together to develop port related facilities
in Uthuru Thilafalhu UTH.

It is the priority of Maldives to develop an I–Haven. India is ready to
enter into a partnership with Maldives for this project.

We have also decided to set up Police Academy, construct Defence Ministry
building and speed up security related infrastructure projects in the
Maldives.

President Yameen and I are fully aware of the prevailing damages and
menaces of cross–border terrorism and radicalisation in South Asia.

In consideration of this challenge, information exchange between security
agencies and training and capacity building of Maldives Police and
security forces is an important part of our security cooperation.

Both the countries have also agreed to further strengthen their
friendship and partnership in the relief and security work at the time of
natural disasters.

Friends,

Both of us also discussed in detail the formation of partnership in the
trade, economics and investment. We welcome the third Maldives Investment
Forum to be held in India. It will further strengthen the investment and
business relations between the two countries.

It is our priority to participate in health services. Upgradation of the
hospital constructed by India in the year 1995, further strengthening the
team of doctors, establishment of health related institutions,
availability of medicines and modern techniques related to health
services are the important aspects of this cooperation.

The agreement held today in the tourism sector would boost economic and
people–to–people ties between both countries.

Crossing the water and land, our collaboration is today touching the sky.

The agreement signed today on South Asian Satellite would immensely help
the Maldives and South Asian countries in the fields of education, health
and tourism.

Maldives abounds in cultural heritage. The agreement negotiated today on
conservation and renovation of ancient mosques and historical monuments
in the Maldives would further improve our cultural ties.

Friends,

President Yameen–ji has conveyed me the information related to political
and institutional reforms taking place in Maldives. India supports each
and every such effort which empowers the citizens and politics of
Maldives.

Excellency Yameen,

India is such a well–wisher, which will match steps with the Maldives in
its journey towards progress in all circumstances. India will always be a
close friend and a trustworthy partner to the citizens of Maldives.

With these words, I once again welcome you on this land of India.

Thank you

President of ASSOCHAM Balakrishna Goenka ji, Secretary General Deepak Sood ji, lakhs of members of ASSOCHAM, stalwarts of the Indian industry, other dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen present here!!!

ASSOCHAM has crossed a very important milestone today. The experience of 100 years gathered by a person or an institution is an extremely valuable thing.

I congratulate all the members of ASSOCHAM.

I have been told that the event is being shown live through video conference at almost a 100 locations.

I congratulate all those involved in this programme, the entrepreneurs and especially those associated with the MSME sector.

Friends,

There are only a few days left in the year 2019. May the New Year and the new decade of 2020 bring happiness, prosperity and success to all of you and may you achieve your goals. I will begin with this wish.

Friends,

The theme that you have set for your centenary celebration is related to the goals and dreams of the nation and the countrymen. And the topic of turning India into a $ 5 trillion economy has not emerged out of the blue. In the last five years, the country has strengthened itself so much that such goals can both be set and achieved. You are well aware that 5-6 years ago our economy was moving towards a disaster. Our government has not only stopped this but has tried to bring about a discipline in the economy.

We have made fundamental changes in the system, have taken decisions on all fronts, and have focused on meeting the decades-old demands of the industries so that India's economy moves towards its goals on a set of rules. And so now a strong foundation for the $ 5 trillion economy has been laid. We are placing India's economy on two important pillars of Formalization and Modernization. Various efforts have been made such as increasing digital transactions, GST, Aadhaar Linked Payment and DBT to bring most of the factors of the economy into a formal system.

Besides, we have also moved towards modernizing and speeding-up the economy using modern technology.

Now company registration takes only a few hours instead of several weeks; time has also been reduced through automation in trading across borders; there has been a reduction in Turn Around Time at Ports and Airports through better linkage of infrastructure. These are all examples of modern economy.

Friends,

Today, we have a government in the country which listens to the industries; understands their needs and works with full sensitivity to their suggestions. Didn't the industrial world want the tax net in the country to be reduced so that it could get rid of the problem of different tax rates in each state? Our government fulfilled this demand by working day and night. We brought the GST. Moreover, with whatever feedback we got from the business world, we kept on reforming and improving the GST.

Friends,

For years, India's industrial world had been demanding a simpler business process. They wanted the government to make processes transparent and simple. Our government also acted on this demand of yours. Today, India is among the top ten countries in the world which has consistently improved the rankings of Ease of Doing Business, the best in the last three years. We have now moved from 142nd to 63rd position in the 190 countries ranking. Was that easy?

It takes four words to say Ease of Doing Business, but its ranking changes when there is hard work, and the rules are changed at ground level.

Whether it is about giving electricity connections, construction permits, or clearance on Export-Import, the rankings improve after hundreds of processes are simplified and several barriers are removed altogether. We are constantly working to improve it further.

Friends,

You also know that there were hundreds of such provisions in the Companies Act, which allowed criminal action even for small mistakes. Our government has now de-criminalized many of these provisions. The process to get many more provisions out of the category of crime is still in progress.

Similarly, our government is constantly working towards ending the 'Inverted Duty'. This has been taken care of in the last budget. As a result, the expenditure on manufacturing in India is also coming down.

Friends,

Since October this year, there has been another historic beginning in the tax system of the country. We have moved towards a direction where there will be no human interface between the Taxpayer and the Income Tax Department. We are moving towards the Faceless Tax Administration to bring Transparency, Efficiency and Accountability in the tax system.

Friends,

There were many discussions in the country for years to reduce corporate tax and to simplify its process. Who took concrete steps regarding this too? It is our government. The Corporate Tax in the country today had never been this low before. That means if there is any government imposing the lowest corporate tax rate on the industries, then it is our government.

Friends,

Discussions on Labour Reforms have also been going on in the country for several years. Some people also believed that it was best to not to do anything for the labour class. That is, just leave the things as it is and allow the same condition to continue. But our government does not believe so.

We believe that the Labour Force should also be taken care of in every way. Their lives should be made easier. They must get provident fund and the benefits of health services on time. The government has worked in all these areas.

So keeping in mind the suggestions of the labour unions and the industry, we have also made several changes in the labour law which is the need of the hour. But friends, some people think that it is their responsibility to question each and every decision that we take in the interest of the industries to make the economy transparent and stronger.

The nation should never forget how the people responsible for the economy kept mum when the economy was getting ruined in the years prior to 2014.

I do not want to get into the details of the kind of economy we had inherited, the kind of stories that were carried by the newspapers, and the credibility of the country at the international level. But the permanent measures that we have taken to mitigate the effects of the conditions that existed during that time have laid a huge foundation for a $ 5 trillion economy.

Friends,

You also know very well the kind of crisis the banking system of the country was in before 2014. The situation then was that banks had to do a provisioning of nearly Rs 6 lakh crore of capital to make up for the loss. The government provided Rs 70 thousand crore under the Indradhanush scheme and then 2 lakh 36 thousand crore rupees through recap.

Friends,

Due to the steps taken by the government, now 13 banks have returned to profit. 6 banks have also come out of PCA. We have also accelerated the merger of banks. Banks are now expanding their nationwide network and are poised to establish their global reach. Our government has eliminated any interference in the business decisions of banks.

Bank Board Bureau has been constituted for the appointment of qualified people in a transparent manner without the intervention of the government. Banks have been given complete autonomy by keeping RBI and external experts. Now you will not hear any murmuring on appointment to senior positions in banks!!!

Friends,

Our government believes that many times in a growing economy, we also have to accept the failure of companies. Not all failures are due to any economic crime. Therefore, the government has paid attention to the fact that such companies and their owners have a better exit route.

Today, IBC - Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is becoming helpful to many companies which are facing failures due to some or the other reason.

This is an attempt made by the government for handholding so that such companies can learn from their experiences, and do something better in future.

Friends,

All these decisions made are going to be of great help in safe-guarding the industry and its capital.

Today, from the platform of ASSOCHAM, I want to assure the people associated with banking in the country, the people of the corporate world that the old weaknesses have been overcome to a great extent. So take decisions openly, invest freely and spend freely. I assure that there will be no unfair action on the right decisions and on genuine commercial decisions.

Friends,

Today, we can say that the foundation of the country's banking system has now become so transparent and strong that it can empower to reach the goal of a $ 5 trillion economy. Even today we are one of the 10 best FDI destinations in the world. FDI inflows into India have increased over the last few years.

I believe FDI has two meanings. I use them both according to the occasion. One means Foreign Direct Investment which most of you know, and the other one for me is ""First Developed India"". About 50 per cent of the FDI that has entered into the country in the last 20 years has come in the last 5 years. We have also greatly improved our global competitiveness over the years. Today, the third largest Start-Up Ecosystem in the world is in our country. A new environment of innovation and enterprise has been created in the country. Today most of the world's investors are looking at India with full confidence and hope. Unprecedented confidence has arisen in the world about India's capability.

Friends,

Based on this same positivity, we are going to move towards a $ 5 trillion economy. An investment of 100 lakh crore rupees on infrastructure in the coming years, will give it strength. An investment of 25 lakh crore rupees on the country's rural economy will help achieve this goal. An investment of Rs 3. 5 lakh crore to provide water to every household will give it a new boost.

Several efforts such as construction of 2 crore new houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, or the resolution to provide affordable Healthcare to every countryman, or the efforts to double the income of the farmers or easy fundings for lakhs of MSMEs across the country, or crores of Self Help Groups, will give a new energy and a new confidence to achieve the goal of a $5 trillion economy.

Friends,

Our efforts to nearly double India's economy are not limited to Delhi. We are also encouraging the states for the same. Several steps are being taken to increase manufacturing, export and to expand Make in India. Manufacturing is our priority in the field of technology and defence. We are moving fast on electronics manufacturing.

Friends,

Amidst all this, I am well aware of the discussions that are taking place today on the economy. But we must also remember that during one of the quarters during the previous government's regime, the growth rate of GDP had reached 3. 5 per cent.

Try to recall, where did the CPI headline inflation reach in that period? It had reached 9. 4 per cent. Where was the CPI core inflation? It was at 7. 3 per cent !!! Where did the WPI inflation reach? It had reached at 5. 2 per cent. How far did the Fiscal Deficit go? It was at 5. 6 per cent of GDP. At that time, several quarters of GDP were so severe that the economy was very depressed. I do not want to get into a controversy as to why some people kept quiet at that time.

Friends,

Such fluctuations have come in the country's economy before. But the country has the ability to come out of such a situation every time and to come out stronger than before. Therefore, India will definitely come out of the present situation.

Friends,

Our intentions for the future are clean and we are determined. This government is known for doing what it says. The goal of 5 trillion dollar economy is also possible because the country has done many such things which previously seemed impossible. In 60 months, it seemed impossible to liberate 60 crore people from open defecation. Today it has become possible. Providing gas connections to 8 crore homes in less than 3 years and setting up more than 10 lakh gas distribution centers seemed impossible but has been made possible.

It previously seemed impossible to connect every family with banking system in such a short time, but it has become possible now. It was previously felt impossible to take digital banking to a large population of the country. Today, crores of digital transactions are happening in the country every day. Who had thought that BHIM app and RuPay card will also become so prevalent in this country? But today it has become possible. It seemed impossible to provide a house to every homeless, but it has become possible now. Now if I start giving more examples from the last 6 months, you will miss your lunch break.

Friends,

In this positive and transparent environment of 'Sankalp se Siddhi', opportunities are also expanding for you.

The government stands with the industrial world of India in every way, so that your spirits are better than before, production in agriculture and in companies is better than before, and wealth creation and job creation are also better than before. Through this platform, I will tell the entrepreneurs of the country - you go ahead, you are capable! The world market is in front of us. We have the courage to compete with the whole world. Your resolve and your strength are going to play a huge role in fulfilling India's dream of $ 5 trillion economy.

Your rich tradition is also going to expand and strengthen the 21st century New India. I conclude with the wish that all of you be successful in your efforts.

Once again, many congratulations and best wishes to all of you.

Thank you !!

I salute all the companions of Madhya Pradesh from this land of revolutionaries. This Jansagar which rose in the ocean is an expression of your strong feelings for the creation of a new India. Whenever I see the passion and passion of all your colleagues, I think many times what will happen to them, who are sitting around the night and night to remove Modi, remove Modi. This love of yours towards a worker shows your will to the new India. Friends, especially young partners born in the late 20th or 21st century. His enthusiasm for a new India is his peak today. They take inspiration from the past. They do not carry the burden of the past. This is the reason why the people who understand the country's own heritage with dynasty and heritage are not melting in the new India. Friends, generations passed in the Congress state of the Great Depression after independence, decades passed, but our country lacked basic amenities. It is the result of the criminal negligence of the Congress with the country that the work should have been completed in the first 25 years after independence. For that we have to exert full power in the 21st century.

Brothers and sisters, tell me whether every Indian should have his own pucca house in 25 years of independence or not? Should have been or not? In the first 25 years of 25 years of independence, every Indian household should have an electricity connection or not? Should every Indian have a toilet facility in 25 years of independence or not? Should our mothers and sisters have a clean life and cleanliness or not? In the 25 years of independence, every Indian should have his own bank account or not? Should every Indian's kitchen have been smoke-free in the 25 years of independence or not? Should there have been better health care for every Indian in the first 25 years of independence or not? Brothers and sisters, the work that could not be done in the first 25 years of independence in the 20th century, our government is now working with the goal of completing it before 75 years of independence in the 21st century. By the year 2022, when there will be 75 years of independence, every homeless should have their own pucca house. Every poor has toilet facilities, every household has electricity. LPG is available in every household. Every poor should have a card of Ayushman Bharat. Every village should be connected by road. We are doing day and night for all such facilities. Brothers and sisters, Congress and its companions, the energy of the country, the resources of the country, is being used to complete the work which was not done in time. Who is his criminal? Who is the culprit? Who is guilty? Who is the culprit? Who is the culprit? Only and only Congress people are responsible. I can also say with the claim that if the Congress were in power, it would not have completed even 100 years of India's independence. I say this with confidence. Friends, Congress nomads have done injustice to many generations of the country to benefit their dynasty. Namdars used the time given to them by the country to increase their corruption and black money reserves. Friends, I read somewhere that the Chief Minister of the Congress of Rajasthan said that Modi is an actor. Now the party whose names are so used to remort, then everyone will see it as an actor. Whether it is to run a government through a report, or to play a video game from a report, these people do not think anything ahead of the actor, and so, therefore, waiting for a prime minister in waiting to be sensible, the prime minister in waiting, Congress has For ten years, the actors who have been telling me, they should know that they had imposed an acting prime minister for ten years.

 Friends, in cricket, when the end of the day's play is over, the last over is left or one out, then the player who is the last number is brought. And he works as a night watchman. Night watchmen send. Those who are good players do not send them. The Congress, too, had not thought in 2004 that it suddenly got a chance, and when it suddenly got an opportunity, Rajkumar was not in a position to handle it. The family itself did not trust the prince, the Congress did not trust him and so it was planned to establish a loyal watchman of the family until the prince was ready. And they thought the prince would learn today, learn tomorrow. Everybody kept waiting, there was also an effort to give full training. But everything became useless. But in this effort, ten years of the country were destroyed. Were ruined He did not have the acting PM Remort, he was somewhere else, leaving the worry of the country, he continued to worry about the chair. Ten years the country saw such a government that frustration spread despair everywhere. Finally in 2014, these people were expelled by the people of the country. Friends, Congress lost a whole decade of the 21st century in vain. Atalji's government handed over the Congress to India in 2004, which is about 8 percent growth rate and very low inflation rate in 2004. In 2014, he left India with our growth rate of around 5 percent and average inflation rate of ten percent. An India which was connected to the world by corruption was associated with terror and violence. It was considered unsafe for daughters. Brothers and sisters, to get out of such situation, you formed a strong government under the leadership of BJP at the Center, and today the result is in front of you. And so brothers and sisters, today I have come to ask you for blessings for 2019. Together, from 2014 to 2019 you gave me a chance to serve the country, thank you for thatI have also come for

 Brothers and sisters, India is the fastest growing large economy in the world. The inflation rate which was in double digit at the time of Congress has now been reduced to three or four percent. From mobile phones to high speed trains are being built in India today. Friends, this is not the only thing digesting them. They think night and night how this chaiwala got so sick? And how is taking the country so ahead? This is the question being eaten by them. Brothers and sisters, I am a man of great reverence in God. Our Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi used to consider God as a form of truth. That's how many humans lied, fabricated a false story, took training from foreign experts and made new words. But at some time the truth comes out. God only shows his power. The fort of lies built on the strength of foreign scholars and forces finally collapsed. The truth has been revealed. I tell you what the truth has come out. The Namdar of Congress has accepted that the false accusations were being made against Modi, which were being attacked. Its only goal was here, the only reason was to stain Modi's image. To tarnish Modi's image. He himself has spoken in an interview yesterday. That is why I say that I am not alone, God is with me. Hey, Namdar, the one who has created the particle of Mother Bharati, the more mud will bloom on it, the more lotuses will bloom. Brothers and sisters, you must have seen in the media that while naming this watchman, his own character of Namdar himself is being opened. Friends, Namdar formed a company in England, whose name is also similar to his adventures. The company name was BackOps, BackOps ie back office operation. This was the name of his company. They never operate from the front, they operate from behind the curtain. This company, which was behind the scenes, was closed in 2009. But it was now known that Namdar's partners in the company got the contract to build the submarine submarine in 2011. On behalf of the Government of India, the government was his, sometimes that company. The owner of the company was his friend. Now the public is asking the Congress nominee, you and your partner had only experience of brokerage or licensing, how did you enter the submarine submarine line. Who gave a chance Ever since this act has come to the fore. Since then Namdar and all the raga Darbari have moved to Kopbhavan. Friends, Bofors cannon, helicopters and submarine submarines, as much as you want to dig, land, land, Nabhadar scam sources are opening up, and Michelle Mama is still raging.

Brothers and sisters, Congress only means lies, deceit and deception. Here in Madhya Pradesh, they have reduced the limit. Took votes from farmers in the name of loan waiver and then retracted. I was seeing a report in the media, Congress leaders here were graciously admitting that they have lied to farmers on debt waiver with a clear explanation. Due to this deception, farmers are getting notices of banks, and there is a possibility of going to jail. Brothers and sisters, Hindustan knows his old habit of cheating farmers, injustice to the poor, injustice to the tribals. Let me tell you, when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I tell the experience of how these Congressmen performed. When I was in Gujarat, what these people used to do before the election, once they instigated the tribals, and were going to the tribals and distributing the forms, and also made the forms as if they were government forms, and had people fill the forms Fill this form, you will get the land after the election, and in return used to kill 100 -200 rupees from the tribals. The chaos started, the government woke up, the government saw everything is false, the form was false, the plan was dishonestly killed two hundred rupees from above, all was caught. Then the second election came, then played the second game. He built a cardboard house in the nearest ground outside the Congress office. Very beautiful looking colorful house erected the entire house. And make the form and go to the house of the poor and fill the form to see that this house which we have built or not is a sample, you will make such a house and give it to you. Poor filled the form, the poor person agreed, a good house is about to be found. And took 100 rupees in return and said, just vote for us and give us your house. These days, everything has been caught in Rajasthan. Must be doing in Madhya Pradesh. His exploits were caught in Rajasthan. What did they do? Made a check-like form, wrote 72 thousand rupees and told the poor that you fill the form, your 72 thousand rupees will start coming. Brothers, when everyone went to the government office, it came to know that the Congress had played the game for votes, false people, false forms and Congress. I am sure that this will also be the practice of this Congress in Madhya Pradesh. All of you be cautious, lying like a debt waiver for votes, giving unemployment allowance to the youth, all these lies and filling such forms, making this lie, forging it, it is in the nature of Congress. I have come to warn you.

Friends, when in a state, we have seen many governments. Neither have we seen two CMs anywhere in the country, nor has the country ever seen two PMs. For the first time, there is a two and a half CM government in Madhya Pradesh. Now when there is a government of two and a half CM. So in which direction will it go, brother. Where will he take Madhya Pradesh? Whose order is not accepted by the government. I would say that the leaders of Madhya Pradesh trapped in Dhan Moh and Putra Home, Lake Lakha Banjara ji of SagarMust learn by renouncing The atmosphere of industrialization was ruined by the BJP government and the transfer industry is flourishing. Transfer and earn, the BJP government had very hardly improved the law and order here. Today, small children are being kidnapped in MP in broad daylight. The dacoits are reactivated. The news of atrocities with daughters keeps on printing day by day. Friends, it is the misrule of the Congress here that has maligned India all over the world. Pakistan too realized this weakness of India, understood the helplessness of the forced government. This is the reason that on this day, the terrorists of Pakistan used to come to India and do bombings. And then used to threaten India, the forced government of Congress used to go around the world and wept, Pakistan did this, Pakistan did this, Pakistan did this. Used to cry Brothers and sisters, the BJP-led strong NDA government is in the fray with a strong strategy for national defense. And this watchman is completely alert. It is now clear to the bosses of terror that the new Hindustan now enters the house and kills it. Should you kill or not? Shouldn't you enter the house and kill? Will you be silent just by raising slogans of martyrs immortal stay? Will the bloodshed of the martyrs be avenged by the detachment? Will you let the blood of the martyrs go waste? This watchman has taken an oath to avenge each blood point. I want your blessings, brothers. I want your blessings.

Friends, Pakistan's beloved, super dear terrorist Masood Azhar is not banned, he is banned. The countries of the world have come together to accept the talk of India and have slapped Pakistan's mouth. But this is still a halt, this is just the beginning, the accounts are yet to be done. Masood Azhar, Hafiz Saeed. Or the other terrorists who are growing up in Pakistan have to settle 130 Indians. Now Pakistan has to decide which route it needs. Brothers and sisters, terrorism and Naxalism are eating the country. To double the income of the farmer, to make the life of the poor easier for freedom from scams and touts to liberate the country from terrorism and Naxalism. To overcome water related problems. I worship the same people of Sagar and Vidisha. To make your dream come true, press the button in front of Lotus to break the 2014 record. And when you press the button in front of the lotus sign, then keep in mind that the lotus that your finger is pressing, it will give home to the poor people of this country for one to five seconds. A conscious decision of yours will keep this watchman working for three or five seconds to eliminate terrorism for five years. Brothers and sisters, when you press the button on the lotus sign, every single vote will go to Modi's account.

Brothers and sisters, now the last phase of the election is going on, tomorrow is the fifth phase of voting. My best wishes to all the voters where there is voting, and they may vote overwhelmingly no matter what the summer is. This is my prayer to him. And my request to you is, you tell me, you want India to be strong, country should be strong, India should be strong, government should be strong for India to be strong, you are confident in your strength, you are ready for strength. Government will strengthen for strengthening. Will make this watchman strong. To make this watchman strong, your polling booth will be strengthened. Your polling booth will be strengthened. Lotus will feed in polling booth. Till election, they will go home, expel voters, vote. Will take full force

"i68165","t20160812692402","I am very happy to note that all our colleagues have expressed one voice
and one sentiment.

Today, when we talk of Jammu and Kashmir, we should talk about four parts
of the State of Jammu and Kashmir: Jammu, Kashmir Valley, Ladakh, and
Pakistan–occupied Kashmir.

I am thankful to leaders of all political parties for the concerns they
have expressed about the current situation in parts of Jammu and Kashmir.
The rich traditions nurtured by our democracy for last six decades have
been the biggest strength of unity and integrity of our country. We may
have some differences on some issues but when it comes to the integrity
and sovereignty of the country, we all stand united.

Like every Indian, I have been deeply hurt by the recent incidents in
Jammu and Kashmir. It is very sad to see that children are not able to
study, apple produce is not able to reach the mandis, shopkeepers are not
getting their daily income and Government offices are not able to work
for the service of the people. The poor are the worst affected by this
situation.

Our existence as political workers is on account of the people. They are
our strength, our source of energy; In fact, people's power is a vital
part of our public life. Irrespective of whether a civilian or security
force personnel is injured or killed, the pain is felt by all of us. I
express deep sympathies to their families. We are committed to provide
the best healthcare services to the injured; we want to restore peace in
the Valley at the earliest possible so that people can lead their normal
life, can earn their livelihoods, send their children to school and sleep
peacefully at night.

We are committed to a permanent and peaceful solution to the issue of
Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with the basic principles of the
Constitution. We have an open mind and our doors are always open. We are
committed to the welfare of every citizen of the entire State of Jammu and
Kashmir. We have been following the path shown by Shri Atal Bihari
Vajpayee ji to find a solution.

Jammu and Kashmir is often called the crown of India. In fact, Jammu and
Kashmir is a symbol of the age old commitment of equanimity towards all
creeds (sarv–panth sambhaav), where Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Muslims
have been living together for centuries. The state of Jammu and Kashmir is
the symbol of our founding fathers' faith which defines us as Indian in
spite of our diversity. Jammu and Kashmir is not only a matter of our
territorial integrity but also defines our nationhood. We cannot deny the
fact that the security forces have suffered a lot of injuries; that they
have been the target of planned attacks. Despite this, our security
forces have shown restraint. Statistics reveal that security personnel
have been injured in large numbers.

Despite false propaganda by certain elements in Kashmir, the percentage
of those spreading confusion and unrest; and those instigating youth is
very low. Every Kashmiri wants peace, has faith in Democracy. That is
why, despite threats by separatist elements during every election, the
Kashmiri people have expressed faith in the Indian democratic system in
each election (festival of Indian democracy). Even just prior to the
recent disturbances, high votes were cast in the constituency of Chief
Minister Mehbooba ji. Therefore, to spread the myth that this is a public
agitation is far from the truth.

In some areas certain restrictions were imposed in order to maintain law
and order. This is an administrative way of maintaining law and order.
Otherwise the lives of peace loving people will be affected adversely. In
reality, a common man was not troubled as much by such restrictions, as
he was troubled by continuous strikes declared by separatist elements.

During this period, the Amarnath Yatra proceeded smoothly. In addition,
the State Government has taken up a number of initiatives on solar energy
in the Ladakh region. The NEET, CET, and UPSC Civil Services Exams were
organised as per schedule. All essential commodities were provided to
citizens. We are now approaching the crucial season for tourism. The
Apple crop will also be ready for harvest. This is of paramount
importance for the livelihood of a common Kashmiri. Certain separatist
elements are trying to take advantage of this time and disturb the peace
in Kashmir, and unnecessarily disrupt the lives of peace–loving citizens.

The fundamental reason for disturbances in Kashmir is cross–border
terrorism promoted by our neighbouring country. Due to terrorism normal
life in Kashmir Valley is affected. Since the start of Terrorist
activities in Kashmir in 1989–1990, in action by the Security Forces:

More than 34,000 AK 47 Rifles were seized.

More than 5000 Grenade launchers were seized.

Around 90 LMGs were seized.

More than 12,000 Revolvers were seized.

 3 Anti Tank Guns and 4 Anti Aircraft Guns were seized.

More than 350 Missile Launchers were seized.

 63,000 kilograms of explosives including RDX and more than one lakh
Grenades were seized.

During this period more than 5,000 foreign terrorists were killed
which is almost equal to the strength of 5 Battalions.

When weapons have been seized in such huge numbers, so many foreign
terrorists have infiltrated to spread death and destruction, the world
will never accept the false propaganda of Pakistan, even if it speaks a
hundred thousand lies.

Pakistan forgets that it bombs its own citizens using fighter planes. The
time has come when Pakistan shall have to answer to the world for the
atrocities committed by it against people in Baluchistan and PoK.

We are fully committed to the fundamental rights of the people. Our
anti–terror laws are more humane than those of any other democracy in the
world. Our governments and our security forces have shown restraint in
dealing with these incidents.

India will fight against terrorism with full might and resolve. This is
our national duty. To consider India's commitment to the Rule of Law,
as a weakness, will be a mistake by our opponents. India is committed to
end terrorism. For us, 'means and ends' are both important and we are
sufficiently capable in both these regards.

It is also a fact that Kashmiri Pandits have been displaced from their
centuries–old ancestral dwellings in Kashmir Valley. Such atrocity
against a particular community is the misdeed of terrorists trained and
armed with weapons by Pakistan, and their sympathizers. These can never
be the deeds of those who believe in “Kashmiriyat.”

For the all round development of Jammu and Kashmir, a decision has been
taken for implementing a development package of more than Rs. 80 thousand
crore (800 billion rupees) in consultation with the State Government.
This package not only has proposals for roads and electricity projects,
it actually envisages development of every region and every section of
society of Jammu and Kashmir. This includes better facility for education
of children, employment to youths, modern facility for treatment,
facilities for promotion of tourism in the state and special arrangements
for production of fruits in the State.

In order to provide employment immediately, the government has decided
that 10 thousand Special Police Officers (SPOs), about 1200 Para Military
and about 4000 candidates in 5 IR battalions will be recruited. In
addition, about 1 lakh 25 thousand (125,000) persons will be trained
under Udaan and HIMAYAT schemes so that unemployed people can get
appropriate employment.

The PDP–BJP government led by Ms. Mehbooba Mufti is making best efforts
to address the State's problems. During the last one month, the
Government has tackled the situation very carefully in spite of extremely
adverse circumstances. The whole nation stands with her.

I would like to reiterate that the Central and State Governments are
committed to address the people's genuine grievances and restore peace
in the state. We will deal strictly with acts of violence, terrorism and
anti India activities. At the same time, genuine grievances of every
person will be heard and addressed.

I would like to reiterate that all the political parties and all Indians
will have to stand united in the fight against terrorism and destructive
forces. At a time when terrorism is spreading its wings across the world,
and terrorism is being instigated by our neighbour, we will have to fight
this battle unitedly. The government has an expectation of constructive
cooperation from all political parties in this matter. All political
parties will have to bury their differences and cooperate to restore
peace and prosperity in the state. I fully believe that with the active
efforts of the state government and with your full cooperation, we will
be able to restore normalcy in Jammu and Kashmir very soon.

I would like to reiterate our main steps and our policy in respect of
Kashmir:

1) It is the duty of any Government to maintain law and order. There will
be no compromise with terrorism.

2) In today's age, in accordance with democratic traditions, we will
encourage involvement of civil society with citizen activities.

3) We will take forward the political process, in accordance with
democratic traditions.

4) The process of connecting Kashmiri youth with economic activities of
the State will be speeded up.

5) The States in which people of Jammu and Kashmir are residing, whether
they are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs or Buddhists or of any religion, should
approach them and should make efforts so that they can establish contact
with their relatives in Jammu and Kashmir and can apprise them about their
own progress and the progress in other States of India.

6) Ministry of External Affairs should make efforts to approach the
people of PoK residing in different parts of world and collect
information about the miserable conditions in PoK and bring them to the
knowledge of the world community.

I once again thank you all for giving your important views and
suggestions in this meeting. I thank you all for supporting the
Government. We all are committed to this national spirit that there
cannot be any compromise on India's territorial integrity. We are ready
to address grievances of all sections within the framework of the
Constitution.

Thank you.","pms","modi","2016","201608","20160812","pmo","firstterm","nda2","statepol","speech","other","other","other","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","hindiother","xxxxx","httppibnicinnewsiteprintreleaseaspxrelid148883","nmo2016","4697","4697","notrans","collective","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","modi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","nmo_spe","na","yes","others","m","bjp","nmo_st","nmo_nda2","bjp_spe","bjp_st","bjp_nda2","m_spe","m_st","m_nda2","pms2016","pms_spe","pms_st","pms_nda2","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_st","nmo_nat_st","nmo_p1_st","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_st","nmo_nat_st","nmo_p1_st","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_st","nmo_nat_st","nmo_p1_st","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_st","nmo_nat_st","nmo_p1_st","modi_spe","modi_spe","modi_spe","modi_st","modi_st","modi_st","modi_nda2","modi_nda2","modi_nda2","nmo","nmo","nmo","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_st","nmo_st","nmo_st","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiother","pms","nmo","st","spe","f","bjp_nmo","bjp_spe","bjp_nda2","bjp_st","lib_nmo","lib_spe","lib_nda2","lib_st","lib_bjp","lib2016","lib_bjp_spe","nmo_spe_2016","nmo_st_2016","bjp_spe_2016","bjp_st_2016","other","o201608","nmo_spe_201608","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_st","pms_spe","pms_st","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","Ms","Ms","Ms","Ms",NA,NA,NA,1709
"i72168","t20170912197398","Your Excellency President Alexander Lukashenku 

Friends,
Members of the media


I am delighted to welcome President Lukashenku to India. His visit comes as both countries mark 25 years of our diplomatic relationship this year.


We have earlier had the pleasure of receiving President Lukashenku in India in 1997 and in 2007. During this visit, I hope Your Excellency will get a chance to see and experience the transformations taking place in India. 

Our discussions today were wide–ranging and forward–looking. They were marked by the warmth of our ties over two and a half decades. We exchanged views on bilateral issues and on regional and global developments. We reviewed the architecture of our partnership. We considered ideas and initiatives for further expanding it. We decided to enhance our interaction in all aspects of cooperation.


I found in President Lukashenku matching enthusiasm and desire to scale up our partnership for the benefit of our people. 


To this end, we will work to diversify economic linkages. The focuswill be to build upon the natural complementarity between us. 


Our companies have to evolve from a buyer–seller framework to deeper engagement. There are abundant business and investment opportunities in pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, heavy machinery and equipment. Last year, Indian companies made a positive beginning with three joint ventures in pharmaceuticals.


Possibilities for partnership also exist in manufacturing of tyres, agro–industrial machinery, and mining equipment. Similarly, in heavy–duty construction machinery India has a growing demand and Belarus has industrial strengths.

We will also encourage joint development and manufacturing in defence sector under the Make in India programme. We have also progressed our discussion on utilising the US$ 100 million line of credit that India had offered in 2015 in specific projects in Belarus. 

India is linked with Belarus under multilateral economic initiatives such as the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) and the International North South Transport Corridor. India is negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with the EEU. 

Friends,

Science and technology is another area of focus for stronger cooperation. Belarus is a long–time partner in this field. 

Innovation and commercialisation will be given due emphasis in fields like metallurgy and materials, nano–materials, biological and medical sciences, and chemical and engineering sciences. We envisage participation of our youth in this process.


We are exploring the setting up of a technology demonstration Centre in India to showcase Belarusian technology.

Another dimension of India's partnership with Belarus lies in development cooperation. Belarus is an active participant in Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation programme. 


In international forums, our two countries have close cooperation and common approaches on matters of mutual interest. 

India and Belarus will continue extending mutual support for each other in multilateral fora. 


Friends, 

President Lukashenku and I discussed the rich history of cultural interactions between our people, which has nurtured goodwill. I was pleased to learn that many Belarusians take active interest in Indian culture, cuisine, films, music, dance, Yoga and Ayurveda. 


I see great potential to enhance our tourism and people–to–people exchanges so as to build an even stronger foundation for our relations. 


In closing, I want to thank President Lukashenku for being our honoured guest. India will work closely with Belarus in the coming days and months to implement today's consensus and outcomes. I wish President Lukashenku a memorable stay in India.


I thank you.

"i57070","t20120920880164","Dr. Dalia Schipper, Mr. S Mahalingam, My Colleague Mr. Vaju bhai Vala, Mr. Joti, Ladies and Gentlemen!

We have assembled here to discuss a very important issue – empowering our youth with the Knowledge and Skill–sets of the 21st century. For me, this in fact is
the most important dimension of our great nation's developmental story. I am extremely happy to be here.

More than 50percent of India's population is below 25 years of age. We enjoy an average age of 24 years – while a large part of the world stares at an ageing population.

I see India's youth as one of its biggest strengths and most valuable resources. I strongly believe that if India is able to invigorate its talent pool – its youth in one decade will be the
engine of growth not just for India but for the world. If we convert our youth population into a
skilled workforce, we can meet the entire world's workforce requirements.

In line with this strong belief in Youth Power – Gujarat has invested substantial time and resource in facilitating their all round development. We believe
education and skill development are the most powerful mechanisms for empowering our youth.

With a holistic approach we are increasing the reach of education and training. More importantly, we are also enhancing its quality. This is being done in line with the latest international trends in
promoting innovation and
nurturing human resource.

And the results are visible for all to see. Gujarat presents the best picture in employment generation. A recent survey of Government of India says that Gujarat has the least unemployment rate.

Gujarat also presents the best picture in development of skills – hard as well as soft.

Many of our initiatives are now recognized as best practices nationally. To give a few leading examples:

    Our iCREATE initiative is being hailed by everyone for its innovativeness.
    Through SCOPE we are building English language proficiency in the youth of Gujarat.
    Recently, we have launched eMPOWER to prepare our youth in IT and electronics skill–sets.
    Various other initiatives nurturing all–round development include the likes of Vaanche Gujarat – a drive for reading, Khel Mahakumbh – a statewide drive for encouraging various sports, Innovation Commission, Choice Based Credit System and so on

 

Specific to the domain of skill development – Gujarat has given top priority to developing modern technical and professional skills in our youth

The
Gujarat Skill Development Mission and
Gujarat Council of Vocational Training aim to make each and every youth employable. Our
Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) play a central role in this. The number of ITIs have increased five–fold over the last decade. Our ITIs have been upgraded with new buildings, new machinery and state–of–the art infrastructure.

Courses have been updated, and their number and diversity dramatically expanded.

20 Superior Technology Centres (
STCs) have been launched – which provide specialized training using state of the art technology. These are driven by industry needs and future human resource demand.  Examples would include STCs related to Automobile Servicing and Solar Technology. We have also opened a powerful window of opportunity by enabling ITI students to pursue Diploma and Engineering courses after their ITI education, thus widening their career horizons.

One of the best parts of the story is that our efforts are powered through partnership with the industry. More than 50percent of our ITIs are now running on
PPP basis – through partnerships with a range of national and international companies and institutions. This is going to be further strengthened today with MoUs being signed for setting up new Skill Generation Centres

My experiences in Gujarat reaffirm my strong belief that India must place at the
top of its agenda the task of empowering its youth with
Knowledge
and Skill–sets. We in Gujarat are already sowing the seeds for the same.

We remain committed to turning every young mind of Gujarat into a powerhouse of motivation, hard work and innovation.

From this perspective, this convention is very important. That is why we have organized it as an important part of our 6th Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit.

"i79322","t20190422501337","Bharat Mata Ki… Jai, Bharat Mata Ki… Jai.

Udaipur has come many times, even before and after becoming Prime Minister, but the enthusiasm that is visible this time is unprecedented. Make full vigor of Bharat Mata with me so that the whole of India can see this enthusiasm of Mewar.

Bharat Mata Ki… Jai, Bharat Mata Ki… Jai.

Friends, the responsibility of increasing the splendor of Maa Bharti is also on the companions who are voting in the Lok Sabha elections for the first time in the twenty-first century. Those born in the twenty-first century, the rest of the people, one will vote for five years, some will go to vote after imagining ten years. But the one who is born in the twenty-first century will press the button this time, then the 21st century will be in his heart and mind because he has to live in this century. He has to cherish his dreams in this century, he has to fulfill his dreams in this century, all that is for him is this century and the fate of this century in these five years, because a quarter of this century in these five years On perfection, the strong foundation of the country that will be built in these five years is going to determine the fate of the 21st century. So, born in the 21st century, I am going to vote in the Lok Sabha elections for the first time, I wish all the sons and daughters many wishes from this land of Mewar. And I welcome you as the Prime Minister of the country for your entry as a voter in the process of destiny of India. On 23 May, tomorrow is 23 April. After a month, on 23 May, the results of the election must have come so far, on 23 May, when the Modi government once again forms the AAP, then we are all ready to live up to this dream.


Friends, with the support of all of you, the Bharatiya Janata Party-NDA has shown that it is possible to run an honest government in this country. A new way of honesty is now being established in the entire country with the support of AAP. Now if a rich person does not return the money of the banks, then he will not be able to sleep peacefully. Now if someone tries to escape from the country then it will be difficult for him to run away, now if someone has run away abroad, he will either have to come back or he will be picked up like Michel uncle of Namdar. Brothers and sisters, it is our government that has punished billions of billions of usurpers of banks, confiscated their property. And has given respect to honest taxpayers. Friends, the earlier government used to force its close ones, its billionaire friends, by putting pressure on the banks, to get a loan from the tradition of phone banking. Today, we are giving loans under the Mudra scheme without guarantee to the poorest of the poor, without guarantee to our tribal brothers and sisters. 17 crores, lending such loans may have happened in the country for the first time and among them a quarter of a quarter crore people, who took money from the bank, started their new business. Similarly, for the first time, more than 40 crore such unorganized workers, those fellows, who are engaged in service with full honesty, have been given pension facilities. Who are these people, mothers and sisters who come to the house to clean the dishes, people who come for cooking, people who take rickshaws to take children to school, people with taxis, people who work inside hotels , People who put up raids, people who sell vegetables, ever thought that after 60 years of age they will get pension, thinking that any government will come, we have made this plan. Not only this, small shopkeepers also manage pension for them, for the first time, the pension for the farmers, for the first time the pension for the farm-laborers.

Friends, Last time when I came to Udaipur, Maharana Pratap Gaurav center built here was also visited. This center has shown in great detail how he and his army hero Bhilu Rana used to carry out surgical strikes on enemies. Brothers and sisters, we belong to the tradition that does not tease anyone, but even if someone teases, they do not leave. It is famous about Mewar that you can eat weeds but cannot compromise your self-esteem. These rites have been given to us by Maharana Pratap, but the Congress and His Excellency, say that Modi should not talk about nationalism, national security, terrorism, in this election. There may be someone else coming to his talk, not Modi. My dear brothers and sisters, tell me Modi is on the right path, the direction is right, the intentions are right, the effort is right, you are fully confident? Modi is attacking terrorism, is it okay, are you happy right? He enters the house and kills. How should the country be protected, should there be talk about this in every election or not? Is this the election of Udaipur Municipality? Is this an assembly election? These are national security in Lok Sabha elections, they are also very important in important issues of Lok Sabha elections. I understand that no one should discuss national defense in the election of Udaipur, but their thinking is so small that they do not understand such a big issue of the country. After 60 years living there, they do not know what are the issues of the country. With six or six abuses from the dictionary, he has been walking around with him since 6 months, Congress and its great people are people who are asking for proof of the valor of our sons. You tell me, will you trust your son, or will you trust those asking for evidence.

Brothers and sisters, the sons of the country have raised the forehead of the country, this gang of proof has forced the country to look down. And those who asked for evidence, these media people must have seen, even on TV sometimesWill also be seen. Ten days ago, the tape recorder used to ring them, those who put a cassette, they used to keep speaking, after this first two steps, the public gave such proof - they gave such proof, their mouths are locked. Now stopped asking for proof, stopped speaking on air strike and I challenge them, come on if you have the courage. You can also go to public meetings and challenge the army's might that I talk about, for the sportsman and horse riders. The public has given evidence to these Namdars. Do not worry, the people of the country are going to selectively answer every question raised on the brave soldiers of the country in the next five phases. Brothers and sisters, many colleagues from Udaipur have gone to work abroad. They are making a huge contribution to the development of India from abroad. With your blessings, the strength of India's passport has increased in the last five years. Whoever goes to any country of the world, in any country of the world, when he shows his passport of India, if he holds the front hand, he does not leave. It is seen proudly towards Hindustani. Brothers and Sisters, it has been our endeavor that the person who goes to work outside should be safe, if there is any problem, the government should help him even in the midnight, this is the work we have done.

Brothers and sisters, our government has continuously tried to increase the country's credibility, increase security as well as make your life easier, an example of this - passport. Facilities like passport and visa More than 300 new passport centers have also been established in the country in the last five years, today Udaipur also has a new passport service center. You will remember how the Congress government here had taken away this facility from you last time, done injustice to you. This time also you have to take account of them. Brothers and sisters, when country is named in the world, it directly affects tourism. Due to the policies of our government, the way the number of tourists coming from abroad has increased in the last five years, the earnings in the tourism sector have increased, the people of Udaipur and the people of Rajasthan have benefited immensely. Friends, Tourism is also directly related to connectivity. There are airport in Udaipur, broad gauge line connecting Ahmedabad, six lane green field highway, many such projects have either been completed or are on the verge of completion. We have taken many developmental steps for highway, railways, airways, in addition to Ivey i.e. mobile phone internet. Efforts are being made to improve the network from village to village under Digital India.

Brothers and sisters, Mangarh Dham near here, a memorial of the valor of Govind Guru, Govind Guru in the freedom struggle, contains the heroic tales of tribal heroes and heroes. And when I was in Gujarat, I never missed an opportunity to come to Mangadh. Govind used to pay obeisance to the Guru, bow to his memory. In that era, in front of the British, a live example of how a tribal fights is in your mangadh. Brothers and sisters, this watchman works with strong intentions and not with promises, and has strong intentions, only then has he pledged to give every mother and sister a gas connection, toilet to house and electricity to every household. Only then, by 2022, Modi has decided to give his pucca house to every poor, every tribal, every deprived and every exploited. He was able to provide treatment of up to five lakh rupees to the 50 crore poor and tribals of the country every year. Otherwise, if the Congress had cheated us for seven decades, if we had not come, you would not have brought us, then perhaps those habits would have continued even today. Here in Rajasthan, there was a promise to waive off farmers' loans but Namdar disappeared after winning the election. Ask the Congress for 10 days free, Hey brother, what happened for ten days? They run like this by hiding their mouths. The era is gone when the people of the country trusted your lies, the country has woken up. Everyone, including youngsters, mothers and sisters, has now recognized your antics.

Friends, these are people who are not even letting you take advantage of PM Kisan Samman Yojana. The BJP government has planned to transfer 75 thousand crore rupees every year to the farmers' account, but these people do not give list of farmers, list, name, rat runs in their stomach. Will give today, will give tomorrow, is seeking here, is seeking from there, is making excuses. Hey Chief Minister, you will be opposed to the BJP, you will be opposed to Modi, at least don't hurt the farmers of Rajasthan, don't do injustice to them. The Congress is best known for telling lies and spreading rumors without developing people. I have been told that to divert attention from the anger of farmers, now these tribal brothers and sisters have started blowing rumors about their rights. There is a need to be careful with their rumors, I want to assure the fellow members of the tribal society completely that this Modi will not let any crisis come on your rights, your honor, your identity.

Friends, our government is trying to extend the benefit of development to every citizen of the country, who has been left behind till now. Brothers and sisters, our Girdia, Kumhar, Banjara such nomadic community, this is the first Modi government after so many years of independence, they have created a separate welfare board for the roaming society and have worried about their well-being. Due to frequent change of place, it is very difficult to reach these people. Now to overcome their problemFor this, the government has decided to create a Welfare Development Board. Brothers and sisters, I have come to pray for all of you to press the button in front of the lotus flower for a strong, secure and prosperous India. I assure you, when you press the button in front of the lotus flower, your vote will go directly to Modi's account.

Brothers and sisters, you tell me, such a big country, should there be a status of India inside the world or not? India's honor and respect in the world should increase or not to increase, should the country be strong for this or not? Should the government be strong to make the country stronger? For a strong government, the watchman also needs to be strong and the watchman becomes strong when 1.25 billion countrymen stand with the watchman. So I urge you, take a pledge with me. With both hands up, closing your fist and after I speak, you have to speak the watchman.

Executive Director, United Nations Environment Program

Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change

Other Distinguished Dignitaries from India and Abroad

Ladies and Gentlemen.

On behalf of the one point three billion people of India, I am delighted to welcome you all to New Delhi.

On the side-lines of this event, I hope the delegates joining us from abroad, shall have some time to see the history and splendour of Delhi.

We are proud to be the global host for World Environment Day, 2018. 

As we celebrate this important occasion today, we recall our ancient ethos of universal brotherhood.

This has been expressed in the famous Sanskrit phrase– VasudhaivaKutumbakam – the world is one family.

The same ethos was reflected in the doctrine of trustee-ship, advocated by Mahatma Gandhi. He had said that ‘Earth provides enough to satisfy everyone’s need, but not enough for everyone’s greed.’

Our traditions have for long stressed the importance of living in harmony with nature.

This is reflected in our reverence of the elements of nature. It is reflected in our festivals, and in our ancient texts.

Ladies and Gentlemen.

India is the fastest growing economy in the world today. We are committed to raising the standards of living of our people.

We are also committed to ensure, that we do so, in a way that is sustainable and green.

In this direction, we have given forty million new cooking gas connections in the last two years.

This has freed rural women from the misery of poisonous smoke.

It has also eliminated their dependence on firewood.

It is the same commitment, which has seen over three hundred million LED bulbs being installed across India. Besides saving electricity, this has also prevented huge additional amounts of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere.

We are engaged in a massive push towards renewable energy generation. We have targeted generation of one hundred and seventy-five GigaWatts of solar and wind energy by 2022.

We are already the fifth largest producer of solar energy in the world. Not only this, we are also the sixth largest producer of renewable energy.

We aim to provide an electricity connection to every household, which will further reduce dependence on environmentally degrading forms of fuel.

We are reducing dependence on fossil fuels. We are switching sources of fuel where possible. We are transforming cities and public transportation.

We are a young Nation. To generate employment, we are working towards making India a global manufacturing hub.

We have launched the Make in India campaign. While doing so, we are laying stress on zero defect and zero effect manufacturing. This means manufacturing that is without defect, and which does not harm the environment.

As part of the Nationally Determined Contributions, India is committed to reducing thirty-three to thirty-five percent of emission intensity of its GDP during 2005 to 2030. We are on track to meet the 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution.

According to the UNEP Gap Report, India is also on track to meet its Copenhagen Pledge. We will reduce the emissions intensity of India's GDP by twenty to twenty-five percent over 2005 levels by 2020.

We have a robust National Biodiversity Strategy. With only two point four percent of the world’s land area, India supports seven to eight percent of the recorded species diversity. At the same time, India supports nearly eighteen percent of human population. Our tree and forest cover has also increased by one percent in the last two years. 

We have also done well in the field of wildlife conservation. The population of tiger, elephant, lion rhino and other forms of wildlife is on the rise.

We also recognize the need to tackle the issue of water availability, which is becoming a major challenge in India. We have launched the massive Namami Gange initiative. This programme, which has already started giving results, will soon revive the Ganga, our most precious river.

India is primarily an agrarian country. Continued availability of water for agriculture is of importance. The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana has been launched to ensure that no farm goes without water. Our motto is ‘More crop, per drop.’

We have also launched a massive campaign to ensure that our farmers convert agricultural waste to valuable nutrients instead of burning them.

Ladies and Gentlemen.

While much of the world focuses on Inconvenient Truth, we have moved on to Convenient Action.

It was this call for Convenient Action that led India, along with France, to form the International Solar Alliance. This is perhaps, the single most important global development, towards the cause of environment, after the Paris Conference.

About three months ago, leaders from over 45 nations, and Heads of International Organizations, gathered here in New Delhi, for the Founding Conference of the International Solar Alliance.

Our experience shows that development can be environment friendly. It need not come at the cost of our green assets.   

Friends.

World Environment Day seeks to address a very significant challenge this year.

Plastic now threatens to become a menace to humanity. A lot of it never makes it to the recycling bin. Worse, a lot of it is non-bio-degradable.

Plastic pollution is already having a deadly impact on our marine ecosystem. Scientists and fishermen alike have pointed to signs of trouble. These include declining fish catches, warming ocean temperatures, and vanishing habitats.

Marine litter especially micro-plastic, is a major trans-boundary problem. India is preparing to join the “Clean Seas Campaign” and make its contribution towards saving our oceans.

Plastic pollution is now entering into our food chain. In fact, micro plastics have now even entered basic food like salt, bottled water and tap water.

Friends.

The per capita plastic consumption in India is much lower than in many parts of the developed world.

Our national mission on cleanliness and sanitation - Swachh Bharat Abhiyan - has a special focus on “plastic waste management.”

A short while ago, I visited the Exhibition set up by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change. It showcases some of our success stories. Among its participants are United Nations, Union and State Governments, industry, and non-government organizations. I hope they continue to do exemplary work in curbing plastic pollution.

Ladies and Gentlemen.

Environmental degradation hurts the poor and vulnerable, the most.

It is the duty of each one of us, to ensure that the quest for material prosperity does not compromise our environment.

As part of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the world had agreed to the theme of “Leave No One Behind.” This is not possible without ensuring that we all come together to protect what Mother Nature has given us. 

 

Friends.

This is the Indian way. And we are happy to share it again with the international community on the auspicious occasion of World Environment Day.         

 

In conclusion, as global host of World Environment Day 2018, I reiterate our commitment to sustainable development.

Let us all join together to beat plastic pollution and make this planet a better place to live.

The choices that we make today, will define our collective future. The choices may not be easy. But through awareness, technology, and a genuine global partnership, I am sure we can make the right choices.

Thank you.","pms","modi","2018","201806","20180605","pmo","firstterm","nda2","foreignpolicy","speech","other","other","other","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","english","textofpmsaddressontheoccasionofworldenvironmentday2018atvigyanbhawan5thjune2018","httpwwwpibnicinpressrelesedetailaspxprid1534449","nmo2018","5132","5132","notrans","collective","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","modi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","nmo_spe","na","yes","others","m","bjp","nmo_fo","nmo_nda2","bjp_spe","bjp_fo","bjp_nda2","m_spe","m_fo","m_nda2","pms2018","pms_spe","pms_fo","pms_nda2","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_fo","nmo_nat_fo","nmo_p1_fo","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_fo","nmo_nat_fo","nmo_p1_fo","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_fo","nmo_nat_fo","nmo_p1_fo","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_fo","nmo_nat_fo","nmo_p1_fo","modi_spe","modi_spe","modi_spe","modi_fo","modi_fo","modi_fo","modi_nda2","modi_nda2","modi_nda2","nmo","nmo","nmo","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_fo","nmo_fo","nmo_fo","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","mint","clean","lib","english","pms","nmo","fo","spe","f","bjp_nmo","bjp_spe","bjp_nda2","bjp_fo","lib_nmo","lib_spe","lib_nda2","lib_fo","lib_bjp","lib2018","lib_bjp_spe","nmo_spe_2018","nmo_fo_2018","bjp_spe_2018","bjp_fo_2018","other","o201806","nmo_spe_201806","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_fo","pms_spe","pms_fo","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","Ms","Ms","Ms","Ms",NA,NA,NA,1226
"i73916","t20180131740500","I bow to Guru Ravidas Ji on his Jayanti. Guru Ravidas Ji was one of the greatest Saints to have been born in our land. He stood for a society that is equal, just and compassionate. His teachings are eternal and are relevant for people of all sections of society.

Guru Ravidas Ji ushered in several positive changes in our society. He questioned practices that were archaic and regressive, and inspired people to change with the times. This spirit of inquiry and emphasis on moving with the times makes extremely great.

Guru Ravidas Ji had unwavering faith in values of harmony and brotherhood. He did not believe in any kind of discrimination. When we work with the motto of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' we are deeply motivated by Guru Ravidas Ji's emphasis on serving every human, especially the poor.

Today I would like to share these words of Guru Ravidas Ji:

My greetings to all you enthusiasts of Chandigarh, Chandigarh has a wonderful inclusion of colleagues from the mountain to the ground. From the farmer to the jawan, I can see the confluence here. Friends, now I request you that I have been with you in Chandigarh for a long time, no one knows in India as much as you know me. If I do not see you today, do not worry, you sit and you have seen a lot. You sit comfortably, let these media people do their work. Let the media people do their work.

In Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Sathiyo, Youthfull and Energetic Chandigarh, your enthusiasm is telling that then a Modi government, once Modi government, once again Modi government. The reason for this is clear that the country is choosing a strong, strong government, not a forced government. The country is choosing India First instead of Family First. The country is opting for development rather than dynasty. The country is choosing those who enter the house and not kill the terrorists after the terror attacks.

Brothers and sisters, the mandate given by the entire Hindustan, including Chandigarh, in 2014, the order which you gave to the Chief Servant has not been able to tolerate it by the Congress and its great partners. In the last five years, they have tried to humiliate my every decision, every plan. When I announced the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan from the Red Fort, all these great people stood up. Hey, how is this PM talking about the toilet at the Red Fort? Poked fun, raised questions like these, such questions bombarded me one after another. When I talked about this, save daughter and daughter, these people also tried to discredit her. When I talked about Make in India and Start Up India, these people also lost their hands after that. When I campaigned for Digital India, they also questioned my thinking. Friends, you will remember that this is the same gang of Congress and its raga courtiers who used to say that the people of India are illiterate. These people used to say that there is no bank in India. In such a way how digital transaction is possible. But in spite of all their conspiracies and questions, we persevered. Today India has a huge network in the form of Rupee Credit Card and Beam App.

India today is a major destination of digital. And our rupee card is respected, so today in Singapore you can use India's rupee card. In this way we are expanding. At the same time, post offices across the country are now being made banking service providers through India Post Payment Bank, India Post Payment Bank. Now Postman has started taking home delivery of banking service to the village with smart phones and other gadgets. Not only this, we have created a digital trinity. JAM JAM i.e. J Jan Dhan bank account, Aadhar card from A, and your mobile phone from M. With the help of JAM Jam, we have ensured that all the beneficiaries of the government schemes get the benefits. Think friends, till now our government has removed eight crore such fake names from the papers. These eight crores are the people who used to go to government facilities in his name. A daughter who was not born, used to get pension as a widow in government offices. One who was not born used to take advantage as a Divyang. Neither the father, nor the mother, nor the child, he is admitted in college and is also taking scholarship. We finished this whole game.

Eight crore, friends, imagine eight crore were just people on paper. We removed it. The ration, pension and scholarship of the poor were being looted in the name of these eight crore people. Let me count from Chandigarh, just imagine the total population of Chandigarh, and compare it with what is eight crore? How many Chandigarh will be a Chandigarh, then these eight crore fake names will come out. You will get a sense of how big this figure is. And this is the work that the young people have come to this public meeting, who were born in the 21st century, who are going to vote in the Lok Sabha for the first time. I tell them, please think a big figure. Comparing eight crore fake names from Total Population of Chandigarh, you will see how a large number of fake beneficiaries in India were going to the tax payers' honesty with middlemen.

 Friends, now you tell me, you tell me when so many middlemen shops are closed. Your love is so bouncing. You can't even stop it. Friends, love cooked on my head eyes. Friends, think of these eight crore fake names who used to be middlemen. Eating days were rubbing. Used to have fun. All these shops were closed by this watchman. Tell me, will these middlemen try to ruin Modi or not? Will you not? Will they make dirty allegations on Modi? Will you lie against Modi or not? So who will protect Modi? Who will protect Modi? Brothers and sisters, I believe that 1.25 billion countrymen are standing as watchmen to protect the watchman. Friends, our DBT because we have implemented a very large amount of DBT scheme from Aadhaar and Bank Account mobile scheme. Direct benefit transfer is the DBT of Bharti Janata Party government, Direct Benefit Transfer, and Congress also has DBT for its high-profile but their DBT is direct intermediary transfer. Brothers and sisters, I am trying to bring transparency through technology. By making new laws, old laws are overI am trying to remove the loopholes in the system. And the same thing is knocking them out. How can one tea one tea one work on the next generation infrastructure of the 21st century? He is irritated by this.

Modi International Solar Alliance has earned a name in India all over the world today. The Head Quarter of the world is made in India. The International Solar Alliance and our mantra is One Sun One Sun, One Sun One World One Grid. How this tea person can talk about this vision, he is irritated by these things. How Modi can make the dream of One Nation One Tax come true. This is bothering them. How can Modi implement Mobility Card i.e. One Nation One Card for the whole country. They have a problem with this. I have done all this, they have trouble with this only. Brothers and sisters, remember how they raised questions about surgical strike and then air strike, surgical strike and air strike. Modi adopted a policy of penetrating terrorists. He did not understand this. You tell me, Chandigarh my dear sisters, this is the right way to enter and kill. Should you do the same? Should those who cultivate terrorism live on the same soil, should they not? Is Modi doing it right? Is your blessing Make me stronger? Friends, who have run the country fearing Pakistan's giddy horrors, they have nothing to say on National Security. Friends, similarly they have acquired the ability to strike in space, raising questions on that. We have had this capability for decades but the Congress's feet tremble in international pressure.

Brothers and sisters, today when there is space control from mobile to missile, is it not our responsibility to secure our satellites, also to develop watchman capability in space. Friends, remember also how these people have protected the country, brother, my love was approved by me, I heard you. I can speak further, I will increase it further, if you allow, I will increase it. I once again say that I put so much love of Chandigarh on my head. I thank you. Is the election going or not? Is walking with Aan-Baan-Shan or not? IPL happened in the country or not? Chandi Mata's Navratri used to run when the election was going on? Is Chandi Mata's Navratri celebrated or not? When the election was going on, the IPL was going on, Navratri was going on. Did Ramnavami fair come or not? Ramnavmi celebrated or not celebrated? Hanuman Jayanti celebrated or not celebrated? Celebrated Easter or not? Right now they are celebrating Ramadan or not. Everything is going on there is no interruption. Not only this, in the midst of so much work, nature suddenly came to a halt and a huge cyclone came to our Easter party and we also handled it and the whole world has cheered the work that India has done during the cyclone, brothers. Now the people of Chandigarh are educated. Three Governments sit here. I just want to ask when can this happen at the same time? And you saw, we did it and why did it not happen earlier? Friends, the people are there, the bureaucracy is there, the officer is also there, the office is also there. But why not before? Why is it happening today? Why is everything happening today? Why is everything happening at once? What is the reason ? What is the reason ? What is the reason ? Hey Chandigarh people your answer is wrong. Hey man Chandigarh people, I have been in your midst and you give wrong answers. Your answer is wrong, it is not happening because of Modi. All this is happening because of your one vote. This is the strength of your vote. This is the strength of your vote that has given India a strong government. And a strong government that has the power to handle so many things at once.

Brothers and sisters, it is also important for you to know what the Congress is thinking. Due to this thinking of Congress, till date in the case of 1984 Sikh riots, all the victims have not got justice. When they are asked about justice, they say in ego what happened? His ego speaks if it happens. It happened It happened Friends, Thousands of Sikhs were thrown out of the house and killed in Delhi. But Congress is saying this happened. It happened It happened Some father's father was burnt by putting tires on the neck of someone's brother, but the Congress is saying it happened. Friends, when Namdar, the closest person in the Namdar family, when the biggest Rajdar of the Namdar family said about the riots of 84 Sikhs, then you can understand whose dialect he is speaking. I say with the claim that if elections were not held in Punjab today, Namdar would not say a word to his guru. Do not pretend to say a word. Remember that when Gujarat elections were there, the person who was a special minister in his government and a very important minister in his government, he said on that day that Modi is despicable. Somebody said that this is of low caste and when a storm broke out in Gujarat, they did a drama, expelled them from the party, made them show up and after a few days, brought it back again and reunited with them. As soon as the stir of the Punjab elections is complete, they will embrace their guru and leave. Brothers and sisters, who abused me in Gujarat, used very bad words for me. He again spoke again yesterday, the same thing that was spoken at that time. But the Congress did the drama at that time and then withdrew. But what they did was wrongThere was no thought. This is the result of that. Not only this, now they have started beating the rhythm and saying that there was nothing wrong in what they abused me. Friends, Namdar's family has ruled the country for decades with this ego. When the scams of millions and crores took place, what did the Congress think? Will you answer my question? Will all of you give? Will you give full strength? I just ask you to remember one more thing Chandigarh and bring it home. When there were scams of millions of crores, Congress thought it happened. Speaking with full force, it happened. When the relatives of the railway minister, when the relatives of the railway minister used to corruption in the recruitments, the Congress thought it was done, it happened, it happened. When the plans used to take decades to complete, the Congress thought it had happened, it had happened. Due to non-implementation of One Rank One Pension, our military colleagues were upset due to that. Congress thought it happened. It happened When the dream of his home was broken by the poor's hand due to black money

Congress thought it happened. It happened It happened When 400, 500 cell companies were being run in small rooms. Thousands of crores of transactions were done with him, Congress thought it happened. What happened, happened, happened The cost of the kitchen was increasing wildly when the middle class was falling back from inflation. It happened It happened Friends, the Namdar of the Congress had said that his name was called and he used to spread it in the world with his court instruments. The Namdar of the Congress had said that the Congress is a thinking, now the Guru of Namdar has told that the Congress thought that it happened. It happened Brothers and sisters, Namdar has the same guru who has insulted the middle class as well. They have said that the middle class is selfish. It is these gurus who make the Congress's Dhoksala letter, who say that they will impose tax burden on the middle class. Friends, the Congress has always insulted the middle class and honest tax payers. While our government honored the middle class. For the first time in history, income up to five lakh rupees, we have zeroed this income in the process of income tax. Apart from this, tax exemption has also been increased in buying your house. Affordable housing schemes have also been introduced for the middle class for the first time. Apart from this, our government has made many tax concessions for senior citizens. Also, neem plants have been made 70 to 80 percent cheaper.

Brothers and sisters, we are continuously working to ensure Chandigarh is of living and is of doing business. You Chandigarh people will be happy because I have been in Chandigarh, so I know that in every house here, the connection of electricity in most of the houses, even though gas stove was used in lakhs of liters, Kerosene was used by the Indian government. There was no buyer of subsidy here, there were few families who needed kerosene. But with millions of liters of kerosene coming in, I got it tested and the kerosene used to ruin the environment was sold in black in auto rickshaws, and the place was sold fresh in black. We said, do survey, take out the list of the households which do not have gas stove, reach the gas stove to everyone, once the gas stove comes in everyone's house, the connection of electricity comes. And you will be happy today that we have been able to make Chandigarh completely kerosene free, brothers. You know how much loot would have gone and whose earnings would have stopped, who would have spent money to contest elections in Chandigarh, you also know. But brothers and sisters, should I work for your good or not? Should work or not work for the good of the country? Should we not work for the bright future of the youth of our country? Even if he is abused for that, should he not? Should he do or not even if he cried out for him? Apart from this, sewer treatment, transport system, work to modernize the airport. We are working today in every field. Friends, in New India and for New India, we have to defeat the insensitivity and the arrogance of ego. And to make the country safe and prosperous. And for this, every vote of yours should fall on the lotus symbol. Every vote on the lotus will go to Modi's account. Brothers and sisters, you came in such a large number and blessed us all. Come here as a Kali Dal, I am also thankful to them, and thank you very much for blessing all of us, but I urge that no matter how hot the summer is, Chandigarh has given its old vote Will all records be broken? Tell me by turning on your mobile phone flash? Will all records be broken? Turn on the flash of everyone's mobile phone. See, the cameras are recording now, not me? Well done… will you get as many votes as possible? Will you get maximum voting? Will you go from house to house? Will the voters meet? Will you press the lotus button? Will the Bharatiya Janata Party win? Will you form a strong government in Delhi? Will you work with full power? Won't you sit peacefully till 19th? Brothers and sisters, thank you very much, speak loudly-

"i63917","t20150515133701","Prime Minister Harper and Members of Media,

I am delighted to visit this beautiful country and this charming city. I
attach the highest importance to India's relations with Canada.

This has been reinforced by my excellent experience with Canada as Chief
Minister of Gujarat.

Our relationship had drifted in the past. In recent years, Prime Minister
Harper's vision and leadership changed the course of our relations.

I am conscious of the significance of this visit in the history of our
relations. I have come at a time when the importance of this relationship
for our two countries has never been stronger.

We are two major democracies with deeply shared values.

Few countries in the world can match Canada's potential to be a partner
in India's economic transformation. And, it exists in a new environment
in India, which is open, predictable, stable and easy to do business in.

Equally, the vast scale of India's transformation, and our rapid economic
growth, offers immense opportunities for Canada.

I seek Canada's cooperation and investment in every area of India's
national development priority,– Energy and Infrastructure, Manufacturing
and Skills,Smart Cities and agro–industry, and Research and Education.

Prime Minister Harper and I are absolutely committed to establish a new
framework for economic partnership. I am pleased that we have made rapid
progress on long pending agreements.

I am confident that we can conclude the Bilateral Investment Promotion
and Protection Agreement very soon. We will also implement the road map
to conclude the Comprehensive Economic Co–operation Agreement by
September 2015.

The thirteen agreements on skill development reflect my commitment to
empower the youth of India with world class skills for India and the
global economy.

The agreement on procurement of uranium from Canada for our civilian
nuclear power plants launches a new era of bilateral nuclear cooperation.

It also reflects a new level of mutual trust and confidence. Further,it
will contribute to India's efforts to power its growth with clean energy.

As the agreement today on Space highlights,we have strong synergy for
cooperation in areas of advanced technologies.

To support greater engagement and people–to–people contacts, we have
liberalised our visa policy for Canada. We will issue Electronic Visa
Authorisation for tourist visa for Canadian nationals. They will also be
eligible for ten–year visas now.

Prime Minister and I agree that a strong bilateral relationship will
provide a solid foundation to pursue our common international interests.

We also agree that in the troubled world of today, our cooperation will
help advance our shared values and peace in the world.

We in India felt Canada's pain when this city was struck by a senseless
act of terrorism.

The threat of terrorism is growing; its shadow extends over cities and
lives across the world.

We will deepen our cooperation to combat terrorism and extremism. We will
also promote a comprehensive global strategy, and consistent policy and
action against all sources of terrorism and its support.

We also agree on the need to enhance our defence and security
cooperation. I welcome our recent agreement on cyber security.

We both recognise that peace and stability in West Asia will make us
safer at home; so will Afghanistan's successful transition.

I believe that Canada is a major Asia Pacific power and should play a
more active role, including in regional institutions, in promoting a
stable and prosperous future for the region.

I look forward to our continued partnership in G 20.

In conclusion, let me say that ours is a natural partnership of shared
values. It is an economic partnership of immense mutual benefit.

It is a strategic partnership that can help address many of our shared
global challenges.

And, it is a relationship nurtured by the emotional bonds of a vibrant
Indian community of 1. 2 million.

I am confident that this visit will be a springboard for a new strategic
partnership between our two democracies.

Finally,Prime Minister has been most gracious and generous in choosing to
go with me to Toronto and Vancouver. I also thank him for returning to us
a precious piece of our heritage.

There is no better evidence of his commitment to our relationship. There
will be no better way for me to experience this country's huge diversity.

Thank you.

"i73721","t20180115901616","His Excellency Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel,
Business Leaders of India and Israel,

Ladies and Gentlemen.

I welcome Prime Minister Netanyahu and members of the Israeli Delegation on behalf of all my countrymen. It is an added pleasure to be with the CEOs of both countries. Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have just completed a fruitful interaction with Indian and Israeli business leaders through the bilateral CEOs Forum. I have high hopes from this interaction and partnership of CEOs, which started last year.

Friends!

I have always had a deep regard for Israel and its people. I visited Israel in 2006 as Chief Minister of Gujarat. Again last year in July, I visited Israel, the first such visit from India.

It was a very special visit. I experienced at close quarters the remarkable spirit of innovation, enterprise and perseverance that drives Israel. There is new energy and purpose that has in–vigorated our ties over the last few years. It will help take our cooperation to greater heights. We stand on the cusp of a bright new chapter in India–Israel relations driven by our people and the mutual opportunities for betterment of their lives.

The role of business and industry is crucial in the transformation of our ties. It is your combined efforts that will add real value to our interaction and produce concrete successes. Given the scale of the Indian economy and the relevance of cutting–edge Israeli technologies for us, even sky is not the limit for what we may achieve together!

Friends!

I am delighted that today we have launched the maiden call for joint RandD projects under the 'India–Israel Industrial RandD and Technological Innovation Fund (i4F)' which was announced during my visit to Israel last July. This Fund, to be utilized over a period of 5 years, is a welcome opportunity to combine the talent pool of the two countries in pursuit of path–breaking technological solutions that can be commercially exploited.

I strongly encourage enterprises in both countries to utilize this platform. Equally exciting is the pick up in science and technology exchanges through joint RandD projects such as in areas like ""Data Analytics” and ""Cyber Space security”.

I am happy to note that the India–Israel Innovation and Technology Conclave is going to be held in India in July 2018. I hope this Conclave will spur co–development of new technologies. In fact, the ground–work for this will be started from iCREATE day after tomorrow. We are both going to Gujarat to inaugurate this campus, which is being developed as a leading innovation hub.

Friends!

I am taking Prime Minister Netanyahu to rural areas of Gujarat because the real power of technology and innovation lies in the benefit it brings to the common man. Israel is universally known as the Start–up nation with a unique eco–system for innovation and incubation.

The credit for this goes to the Israeli entrepreneurs. You have made Israel a strong, stable and innovative economy. You have made a country of 8 million people, shine as a global power–house of technology.

Whether it is Water Tech; or Agri–Tech; whether it is food production, its processing or conservation; Israel has been a shining example with new breakthru and advances. Whether it is physical or virtual security; whether it is on land, water or space; your technology has won admiration. In fact, hailing from a water deficient state in India, I have particularly admired Israel's water efficiency.

Friends!

In India, we have been taking steady steps over three years at both macro as well as micro–level, to make a difference. Our motto is: Reform, Perform and Transform.

The results are two–fold. On the one hand, our procedures, processes and systems are getting aligned with the best in the world. Secondly, we are able to maintain the pace of faster growth.

In spite of deep structural reforms, we are among the fastest growing major economies. FDI inflows are at an all–time high, with 40percent rise. Tremendous work is being done to skill and employ the youth. 65percent of our population is below 35 years of age and is hungry for technology–enabled growth.

This is our greatest opportunity as well as challenge. For this purpose, we have started the Start–up India campaign. There is vast potential for India–Israel partnership in this area. The India–Israel Innovation Bridge will act as a link between the Start–ups of the two sides. I have been saying that Indian Industries, start–ups and the academic institutions must collaborate with their Israeli counterparts to access the huge reservoir of knowledge.
 

India has size and scale.
Israel has sharpness and edge.
There would be many ideas and technologies that can be useful for or can be commercially scaled up in India.

Friends!

Today, we have emerged as one of the largest manufacturing nations. But we are not done yet. We are positioning India as a global manufacturing hub leveraging the energy of our youth. 

The 'Make in India' initiative is designed to help achieve this. Through these initiatives, combined with the new eco–system of a formal economy and a unified tax regime, we are trying to create a NEW INDIA.

We are particularly keen to develop India into a knowledge–based, skill–supported and technology–driven society. A grand beginning has already been made through Digital India and Skill India. To enable this transformation, in the last few years, my Government has undertaken substantial reforms. 

We have resolved a number of regulatory and policy issues facing the businesses and companies. We have worked sincerely on 'ease of doing business' in India.

The results are there to see:
 
In the last three years, India has moved up 42 places in the index of Ease of Doing Business of World Bank;
We have moved up 21 places on the Global Innovation Index of WIPO in two years.
We have also moved up 32 places in last two years in the Global Competitive–
ness Index of the World Economic Forum – the highest for any country;
We moved 19 places on the Logistics Performance Index of 2016 of World Bank ;
We are among the top 10 FDI destinations listed by UNCTAD But we will not stop.
We want to do more and do better.

To enable entry of capital and technology, most of the sectors including defence, have been opened for FDI. More than 90 percent of the FDI approvals have been put on automatic route. 

We are now among the most open economies. Just a few days ago, we have allowed 100percent automatic route FDI in single brand retail and construction development. We also opened up our national carrier, Air India, to foreign investors. 

Every day we are making it easier to do business in India. In taxation, we have carried out a number of historic reforms. The path breaking GST reform has been introduced successfully and smoothly.

It is by far the biggest business and economic reform India has ever done. With introduction of GST and of Financial Technologies and digital transactions, we have really moved towards a modern tax regime, which is also transparent, stable and predictable.

Friends!

Several Israeli companies have joined hands with Indian companies for Making in India. Many others, especially those with advanced water technologies and agri techniques, defence and security systems, and pharma knowledge have a foot–hold in India. Similarly, Indian companies have significant presence in several sectors in Israel like IT, Irrigation and Pharma. 

Diamond remains a strong link in our trade. There are more business joint ventures today than before. However, this is just the beginning. Our trade with Israel has grown to more than 5 billion dollars. 

But this is still well below the real potential. We must attain the full potential of our ties. This is not only a diplomatic imperative but also an economic one. I welcome your suggestions on how to unlock our combined potential. The spirit of innovation, adaptation and problem solving is inherent in both countries. 

Just to give you an example:

Imagine the environmental and economic gains if we can collaborate to save wastage and if we can add value in our fruits, vegetables and horticulture! Similar is the case with water. 

We have situations of plenty as well as scarcity of water. We have situations of food being thrown away even as there are many who go hungry.

Friends!

India's development agenda is huge. It presents a vast economic opportunity for Israeli companies. I invite more and more Israeli people, businesses and companies to come and work in India.

Along with the Government and people, the business community of India too is keen to join hands. I wish your companies and ventures all success. I assure you of my support and that of my Government wherever it is required. And I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his continuous support in fast–tracking India–Israel trade and economic collaboration. I am confident many successes lie ahead for our partnership.

Thank You!","pms","modi","2018","201801","20180115","pmo","firstterm","nda2","foreignpolicy","speech","other","other","other","india","ncr","newdelhi","capital","english","indiaisraelbusinesssummit","httpwwwpibnicinpressrelesedetailaspxprid1516785","nmo2017","5034","5034","notrans","collective","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","modi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","nmo_spe","na","yes","others","m","bjp","nmo_fo","nmo_nda2","bjp_spe","bjp_fo","bjp_nda2","m_spe","m_fo","m_nda2","pms2018","pms_spe","pms_fo","pms_nda2","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_fo","nmo_nat_fo","nmo_p1_fo","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_fo","nmo_nat_fo","nmo_p1_fo","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_fo","nmo_nat_fo","nmo_p1_fo","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_fo","nmo_nat_fo","nmo_p1_fo","modi_spe","modi_spe","modi_spe","modi_fo","modi_fo","modi_fo","modi_nda2","modi_nda2","modi_nda2","nmo","nmo","nmo","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_fo","nmo_fo","nmo_fo","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","mint","clean","lib","english","pms","nmo","fo","spe","f","bjp_nmo","bjp_spe","bjp_nda2","bjp_fo","lib_nmo","lib_spe","lib_nda2","lib_fo","lib_bjp","lib2018","lib_bjp_spe","nmo_spe_2018","nmo_fo_2018","bjp_spe_2018","bjp_fo_2018","other","o201801","nmo_spe_201801","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_fo","pms_spe","pms_fo","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","Ms","Ms","Ms","Ms",NA,NA,NA,1513

Mr. Manohar Lal Khattar, the popular, famous and diligent of Haryana present on the stage, Mr. Narendra Singh G. Tomar, my colleague of the Council of Ministers, Rao Inderjit Singh, Mr. Krishnapalurjar, my colleague in Parliament Mr. Virendra Singh G., Mr. Arvind Sharma Yes, all the Honorable MPs, ministers of Haryana Government, Hon. MLA, party officials and workers Ndhu and my dear brothers and sisters.

First of all, I thank all of you for paying respects to the Bharatiya Janata Party for filling all the seats left in the Lok Sabha elections. In today's era of politics, getting 55-60 percent votes, this in itself I see it as a precious opportunity for public support, public trust, public awareness. The more congratulations I give to Haryana, the less I can thank. For the third time in the last months, I have got a chance to visit Rohtak. Sometimes Chaudhary came to inaugurate the statue of Chhoturam, then in May I came to give you an account of my work and once again I came to ask for more support among you. And Haryana is like this, I have given more than I asked for, I have given a lot of affection and for this I congratulate you from the heart.

Brothers and sisters, there are two major motives behind my today's visit to Rohtak. The first objective is to give you the gift of new development projects and the second is to witness the tremendous public blessings Manohar Lal ji is getting. The scene I have seen here is unprecedented, a lot of people are watching in the sun. All of you coming in such a large number is showing wind. I can say that this public blessing is a living proof of the manner in which Manohar Lalji and his government have served the people of Haryana. Manohar Lal Ji's Jan Ashirwad Yatra may be ending today in Rohtak, but it is clear that with whom Haryana's blessings will be with us in the coming times. And Manohar ji, when I took over the responsibility five years ago, when I became the Chief Minister for the first time in 2001, and as I used to hear all the things for me, Manohar Lal ji too, but five years unanimous, The result of tireless effort is that every family has become beautiful today.

Now the people of Haryana are facing difficulty as to what is the correct name, someone speaks Namohar, someone speaks charming, then one is both included, Namohar is also beautiful. People used to greet me, but when people called me Namohar, I was also surprised. Brothers and sisters, walking on the path of development, serving the poor, the afflicted, the exploited, the deprived, gives public confidence. Today's gathering is putting another stamp on that public trust. In the last five years, Haryana has got the full benefit of the Bharatiya Janata Party's central and state government double engine. Right now, about 25 thousand crores of rupees are being worked out in Haryana with the help of Central Government. Continuing this process of development, the foundation stone of projects worth about 2 thousand crores has been inaugurated and inaugurated a while back. It also includes degree colleges in Sirsa, Palwal, Hisar and Noah for higher education of daughters. I am happy that besides making the Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao campaign a success, the BJP government here is giving extensive emphasis on education of daughters. I congratulate Manoharji and his team. Here the whole country is talking about the increase in the proportion of daughters in the surrounding districts.

Friends, Along with the college, water projects, solar street light work, health facilities, smart systems projects have also been launched here today. Apart from this, houses have also been given to about 600 poor families in Rohtak and the foundation stone of a megafoodpark has also been laid. This foodpark is going to create new income employment opportunities for the farmers of Haryana, for their young colleagues here. My very best wishes to those whose Diwali is going to pass in their new house this time. Many congratulations to all of you, entire Haryana, and many congratulations for all these development projects.

Friends, today I have come here to express my gratitude to all of you, to the entire Haryana. The kind of open-hearted love and belonging, as I said in the beginning, gave direction, support, new energy to BJP in Lok Sabha elections, it is unprecedented. I once again bow my head with humility in front of you for the trust, the trust you have expressed in me and the BJP. Friends, I had said even then that you should be proud of the seat I got from Haryana and the upbringing I received from Haryana, I will never back down in doing such a thing. It is a coincidence that I have come to Haryana at a time when 100 days of the new tenure of BJP-NDA government are taking place at the Center and in a hundred days, some people are not understanding, some people are so much defeated by the election defeat He is upset that his mind has become numb. These 100 days have been for development, trust and big changes in the country. These 100 days have been for decision, sincerely, also for good intentions, these 100 days have been for public resolve, for public welfare, for improving public interest. Friends, whatever major decisions were taken in the last 100 days, their motivation and encouragement is only 130 crore Indians, you are all.

On the strength of your unprecedented faith, take away from agricultureThe government has been able to take major decisions related to the defense and security of the nation. Numerous laws have been enacted to deal with terrorism, to protect the rights of Muslim sisters and for the betterment of our health sector. Similarly, a roadmap has been laid to help different sectors to strengthen the economy. Historical decisions have also been taken to strengthen the banking system in the country. This is just the beginning, whose definite benefit will come in the coming time. Friends, Apart from this, another important work has been done in these 100 days, during this period, the number of bills passed in the session of Parliament, the work done in the last 60 years has not been done in any session. Members of Parliament sat down for very long nights, discussed, debated, debated, disputed, discussed new laws. This platform belongs to BJP but I thank all the parties for the record work in Parliament.

Now the people of Haryana are facing difficulty as to what is the correct name, someone speaks Namohar, someone speaks charming, then one is both included, Namohar is also beautiful.

Members of Parliament sat down for very long nights, discussed, debated, debated, disputed, discussed new laws. This platform belongs to BJP but I thank all the parties for the record work in Parliament.

Brothers and sisters, in the last 100 days, the country and the world have seen that every challenge, whether it is decades old or the future, India now challenges every challenge, we know to confront the challenges directly. Jammu and Kashmir and Be it a case of Ladakh or a serious water crisis. Meet 130 crore countrymen and start looking for new solutions. We, along with crores of colleagues from Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir, have started working to fulfill their dreams and aspirations with a new thought. SaIn the last four months, many such resolutions have been fulfilled by the inspiration of Thi Aap, which we took during the election. We had pledged to provide gas connections under the Ujjwala Yojana, home of 8 crore poor sisters of the country, it has been acquired yesterday in Aurangabad, Maharashtra and more than 7 lakh families got the benefit of gas connections in Haryana itself. is.

We had resolved that the benefit of the Kisan Samman Nidhi will be extended to every farmer family of the country, it has been implemented as soon as the government is formed. So far, more than 7 crore farmer families in the country have received benefits under this scheme, in which more than 13 lakh families belong to our Haryana only. In such a short time, 21 thousand crores rupees have been deposited in the accounts of farmers across the country, and four hundred and fifty crores rupees have been deposited in the account of Haryana farmers. The BJP had made another big pledge of pension for the farming families itself. This scheme, which ensures regular pension of 3 thousand rupees every month, which has given support in old age has also started. In a very short time, about 8 lakh farmers and siblings from all over the country have also joined this scheme, out of which more than 33 thousand farmers of my Haryana are brothers and sisters. It is going to increase massively in the coming time, but soon the pension scheme will also be available to small and small traders and traders.

Brothers and sisters, many such efforts are being made in the interest of farmers, on whose strength the goal of doubling the income of the farmer by 2022 is going to be fulfilled. To reduce the cost of farmers, to get a reasonable price for the crop, to avoid wastage of produce, new projects are constantly being pushed forward. The Megafoodpark to be built in Rohtak is a part of such efforts, this foodpark is going to benefit thousands of farmers and traders of Haryana. With this, about 7 thousand people are going to get new jobs from Foodpark, in addition to this it will also give strength to the infrastructure of food processing, for which an effective supply chain is being developed here.

Friends, there is another resolution of the BJP, in which work has been started on a very large scale. By the year 2024, the country has mobilized to deliver water to every household of the country, the whole country has gathered on water-life mission, Haryana is also taking part in it. It has been decided that three and a half lakh crore rupees will be spent in the coming five years to save water and deliver water from door to door. Haryana is also going to get its benefits today. Today, the reconstruction of the bridal department is a big step in this direction. With the completion of this, now farmers of dozens of villages will get irrigation water, whereas millions of gallons of water which was wasted, can now be used for drinking. Friends, from the land of Rohtak, I would request the whole of Haryana that to save water, your contribution to water conservation is very important. Do whatever small and big efforts we can at our level. We take as much water from the ground or from other sources as is necessary. Bringing this awareness is very important for our children, for the better life of their grandchildren.

Brothers and sisters, the biggest priority is being given to the interests of the poor, whether in the BJP government at the Center or in their work in the state. We do not think in pieces but take all-round steps keeping a big goal in mind. Let me give you an example of this, we all know that there is a need to improve healthcare in India but no one had such a road map before. Which includes the health concerns of 130 crore countrymen. We also focused on improving health as well as the facilities associated with it. Our road map was to remove the conditions that cause people to fall ill ie preventive health care, along with this we worked on easing people's access to health services, making the facilities affordable and taking health facilities to those areas as well Where until now it was deprived. From Swachh Bharat to Yoga, from Ujjwala to Fit India and all these along with the promotion of Ayurveda, every such initiative is making its important contribution in prevention of diseases. On the one hand, while it is helping to prevent diseases spreading from each other, on the other hand, diseases caused by lifestyle are also being cured.

Friends, all the systems of traditional and modern treatment, hospitals, dispensaries, networks are being strengthened throughout the country including Haryana. With this thought, I started 10 AyushHealth and Wellness Center in Haryana a few days ago through video from Delhi. Today the foundation stone of the new medical college has been laid in Gurugram. This will also increase health facilities and our youth will also get more opportunities for medical education. Friends, along with modern medical infrastructure, even the poorest of the poor should get a place in the hospital, they can be treated, work is being done for this purpose. Ayushman Bharat has ensured free treatment to the poor. The Jan Aushadhi Scheme is getting cheaper medicines, the prices of life saving medicines have also been controlled. Friends, if you look carefully, you will find that all the healthcare related steps are being taken in line with the goal of a healthy and strong India. For this, several ministries are working together as a unit. I assure you, we are not going to stop here, there is much more to be done.

Brothers and sisters, Lok SabhaIn the election, you gave a mandate keeping in mind the future of India, now also give for the future of Haryana. A continuation of the last five years: Another opportunity for you to continue for the next five years is knocking at the door. Friends, The BJP government of Haryana is working to increase the pride of the state, today, talking about Swachh Bharat, Haryana is one of the top states in the entire country. Haryana has declared itself to be completely open defectionfree ODF-free, besides Haryana has become a kerosene-free state and Haryana is also named among the top states of the country in the MSME sector. For the better future of Haryana, your state needs leadership like Manohar ji, who has been continuously serving you with dedication, dedication, all our colleagues including Manohar Lal ji have worked in accordance with these rituals in the last five years. Have done In the last five years, Haryana has done away with the discrimination of its alien from the government system, hurting that mentality. In the last five years, there has been a strong attack on familyism and corruption in Haryana. In the last five years, a wrong tradition of Bandarbant has been eradicated in government jobs in Haryana. In the last five years, there has been an increase in the number of unemployed youth from skills to help. Over the last five years, there has been a successful attempt to stop the game of transferposting in the name of teachers. In the last five years, the game of corruption on the farmers' land in Haryana has also stopped.

The entire Haryana stands in favor of the BJP today on the basis of five years of such excellent track record. I am confident that with the BJP, with Manohar Lalji, this belief of the people of Haryana in Rohtak will remain the same. You must have seen here people of the age of 35, 40, 45, 60, 70, who have seen many governments in Haryana, have seen the character of those governments, you know the identity of those governments. Familyism, just and familyism, corruption only and who used to be the chief minister here. If the government in Delhi, the Prime Minister of the country, if the government of the country has any trouble or singing songs of small accomplishment, then it was preferred to the Chief Minister that people from all over Haryana in trucks in Delhi Bring, beat the drums outside the Prime Minister's house and cheer the Prime Minister of that time, do this job, then Haryana gets that Chief Minister. This business was run, in five years, neither the Chief Minister has had to do the work of transporting even a truck from Haryana, nor the government here has had to do it. For Haryana, it is the experience of new work culture, experience of new politics. This government has shown that people who die for Haryana without selflessness are also in Haryana.

Brothers and sisters, today the country is showing its awesomeness in the world. On 7 September, I had another interview in the life of India and I would like to say that the whole country was sitting in front of the TV in front of the TV at 1.50 pm on 7 September. The country and the world were watching the movement of Chandrayaan with an eye to the good news, now it will happen, it will happen, it will happen. 100 seconds after 1 50 minutes, 100 seconds of the night of 7 September, Worli 100 seconds of the morning of 7 September, I did another interview. One incident woke the whole country within 10 seconds, one incident connected the whole of India within 100 seconds. One such spirit and I would say, as SportsmanSpirit talks about. I would say, now it is isospirit in India. Now the country is not ready to accept negativity. Within 100 seconds, the country has changed the meaning of success, failure, now the country worships effort, now the nation worships mighty, now the country has moved on with the belief of change. This mood of 1.25 billion countrymen is very big capital of my life. There is a huge legacy of the bright future of India, people who live in despair, who find pleasure in despair, what is the strength of hope and faith, what is the power of resolution, Kanyakumari from Kashmir in 100 seconds, stuck From Cuttack India has shown.

The country where the resolutions have such a great power to live is a vocalospirit. The country that lives for resolutions beyond the limits of success and failure also fulfills its dreams and hence the tax that the country has shown in that 100 seconds. The instrument was ISRO, the instrument was ISRO scientist, the instrument was a trip to Chandrayaan, but the mood was of 125 crore countrymen. India is lucky, we are lucky that there is such energy inside this country, there are such feelings inside the country, these feelings are going to fulfill all the resolutions of the country.

Brothers and sisters, we are able to take decisions, we are able to take decisions because the people of the country have faith. Except for the national interest, we have no standards, no scales and by that principle, Manohar Lalji gave Haryana a new direction, a new momentum, a new strength. My dear brothers and sisters from Haryana once again congratulate you for the development projects. You came here in large numbers to bless all of us, thank you for that. Speak with me full force,

Thank you very much, Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai.","pms","modi","2019","201908","20190908","pmo","secondterm","nda3","statepol","speech","other","other","other","india","haryana","rohtak","otherstate","hindiother","thelastfiveyearshaveseenharyanaprogressrapidlywiththedoubleenginegrowthpmmodi","httpswwwnarendramodiintextofpmsspeechatpublicmeetinginrohtakharyana","nmo2019","193","5574","gt","saksham","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","modi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","nmo_spe","na","yes","others","m","bjp","nmo_st","nmo_nda3","bjp_spe","bjp_st","bjp_nda3","m_spe","m_st","m_nda3","pms2019","pms_spe","pms_st","pms_nda3","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p2_spe","nmo_da_st","nmo_nat_st","nmo_p2_st","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p2_spe","nmo_da_st","nmo_nat_st","nmo_p2_st","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p2_spe","nmo_da_st","nmo_nat_st","nmo_p2_st","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p2","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p2_spe","nmo_da_st","nmo_nat_st","nmo_p2_st","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_st","nmo_st","nmo_st","nmo_nda3","nmo_nda3","nmo_nda3","nmo","nmo","nmo","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_st","nmo_st","nmo_st","nmo_nda3","nmo_nda3","nmo_nda3","mint","clean","lib","hindiother","pmsgt","nmo","st","spe","s","bjp_nmo","bjp_spe","bjp_nda3","bjp_st","lib_nmo","lib_spe","lib_nda3","lib_st","lib_bjp","lib2019","lib_bjp_spe","nmo_spe_2019","nmo_st_2019","bjp_spe_2019","bjp_st_2019","other","o201908","nmo_spe_201908","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_st","pms_spe","pms_st","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","Ms","Ms","Ms","Ms",NA,NA,NA,3849
"i52702","t20040208928381","I have worked in different regions of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh,
Punjab and Chandigarh before coming to Gandhinagar. I have learnt
through my work and interaction with people that we all have a very
strong tendency to succumb to temptation, no matter how much we
talk about sacrifice. I used to often crave for Gujarati food when I
lived there. Unfortunately, all I got was Punjabi food. There was
only one place where I would get Gujarati food, and that was at the
homes of members of the Devipujak community settled there.
I visit Ludhiana whenever I travel to Punjab. There are quite a few
Gujaratis in Ludhiana. One of our workers who lived there used to
insist on my having lunch at his place. I explained to them that since
I hardly get Gujarati food here, I truly relish it at the residences of
my fellow Devipujak brothers. These are the people who worship
the Mother Goddess. I have seen two communities which I would
like to discuss here. One is the Sindhi community and the other is
the Devipujak community which worships the Goddess. After the
partition of India, the Sindhis had no place to settle down. They had
left their native land, were left homeless, and yet I am sure you have
never seen a Sindhi begging. You will find them selling peppermints
or roasted papads, if worse comes to them, but never begging.

NATURE OF SOCIETY
Another admirable community is the Devipujak community,
which is primarily a business community. You can find women from
this community selling dry fruits or handicrafts anywhere in
Chandni Chowk or at Connaught Place in Delhi. They have Englishspeaking
customers too, and though they do not know English, they
have the ability to sell their wares to the English-speaking buyers
and even saying ‘thank you’ to them.
This is their potential. Business runs in their blood. Whenever
these people get a chance to progress they have always grabbed the
opportunity. It is as if they have a divine grace to fight against odds.
Small religious disputes in Shahpur are part of their day-to-day
lives, but I have never found them complaining. They are strong
enough to tolerate all these problems. They never ask for anything
from others.
But I want to demand something from them. This community has
never begged from anyone but today the Chief Minister of Gujarat
wants to beg for something from them. I will demand only if these
people assure me that they will give me what I ask for. My demand
is that, no matter how tough it is, no matter how difficult it is, please
do educate the girls of your community. I should not find any girl in
this society uneducated. We often request people to educate the girls
in their community, but the reason for not doing so it that they don’t
want their women to take up jobs. They want their women to work
in farms and look after cattle or sell vegetables. “Why should we
educate them?”, they ask. But the fact is that education is not only
for taking up a job. Times have changed. If we want a strong
foundation for the entire Devipujak community, we need educated
daughters.

THE STATUS OF WOMEN
The position a woman holds in the Devipujak community is
remarkable. This community never takes their disputes to court even
today. They form a group of judges who stand in a circle drinking
their cups of tea, holding their sticks in their hands, and listen to the
problem in order to come to a verdict. I often used to observe them
as a novice in my younger days. The way they talk and argue, the
way they cite the rules of their society are truly interesting. There is
a village near Manali in Himachal Pradesh, which is the only village
where women are judges. People from across the world have written
about this. When I visited Himachal Pradesh I found people talking
about this. I told my friends from Himachal that they have failed to
publicize this practice. I told them about our Devipujak community
where even today, justice is administered by women, not men. In the
absence of a single lady member of the Panch, the decisions taken
by the other eleven are considered null and void. Till the lady
member of the Panch approves any decision taken by the remaining
members, it is not considered valid.
The ultimate judgment of the court is in the hands of women. This
shows the path of progress of this community. Women have such
fame and power! Women play such a significant role in the
development of society! I would think that women can be the source
of power not only within their own community, but for our whole
society if they are educated. They can serve the country better.
Thus, this Devipujak community, with an acute business acumen,
courage and thrift, can develop by leaps and bounds if they are
given the opportunity of education.","pms","modi","2004","200402","20040208","gujaratcm","prefirstterm","upa1","statepol","book","other","other","other","india","gujarat","noplace","otherstate","hindiother","book","xxxxx","nmo2004","49","689081","notrans","sneha","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","modi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","nmo_boo","na","yes","others","m","bjp","nmo_st","nmo_upa1","bjp_nmo","bjp_st","bjp_upa1","m_nmo","m_st","m_upa1","pms2004","pms_nmo","pms_st","pms_upa1","nmo_da","nmo_reg","nmo_gc","nmo_da_boo","nmo_reg_boo","nmo_gc_boo","nmo_da_st","nmo_reg_st","nmo_gc_st","nmo_da","nmo_reg","nmo_gc","nmo_da_boo","nmo_reg_boo","nmo_gc_boo","nmo_da_st","nmo_reg_st","nmo_gc_st","nmo_da","nmo_reg","nmo_gc","nmo_da_boo","nmo_reg_boo","nmo_gc_boo","nmo_da_st","nmo_reg_st","nmo_gc_st","nmo_da","nmo_reg","nmo_gc","nmo_da_boo","nmo_reg_boo","nmo_gc_boo","nmo_da_st","nmo_reg_st","nmo_gc_st","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_st","nmo_st","nmo_st","nmo_upa1","nmo_upa1","nmo_upa1","nmo","nmo","nmo","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_st","nmo_st","nmo_st","nmo_upa1","nmo_upa1","nmo_upa1","mint","clean","lib","hindiother","modi_books","nmo","st","boo","p","bjp_nmo","bjp_boo","bjp_upa1","bjp_st","lib_nmo","lib_boo","lib_upa1","lib_st","lib_bjp","lib2004","lib_bjp_boo","nmo_boo_2004","nmo_st_2004","bjp_boo_2004","bjp_st_2004","other","o200402","nmo_boo_200402","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_st","pms_nmo","pms_st","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_b","nmo_b","nmo_b","nmo_b","Mb","Mb","Mb","Mb",NA,NA,NA,841
"i66277","t20160114353469","All the dignitaries present here!

Amazing India and Amazing Indians! Let me first of all congratulate Times
Now for its pursuit to test the diamonds, which illuminate never for
themselves but for others. These are such diamonds, which, as per the
nature of the diamond, face terrible ordeals during their painful and
distressing journey, which starts from their unearthing from the mine and
ends while they shine on someone's body. These are such diamonds, which
suffer and struggle against the hurdles, yet feel a sense of satisfaction
for illuminating the society, country and the world.

It has been the misfortune of our country that for the last 200, 250 or
300 years, most of our writings were concerned with royal families,
rulers, royal lifestyles and their daily routines. Just these points came
to fore before the society. It was part of a deliberate conspiracy also,
to keep the country in the shackles of slavery. And for that reason, the
attention of one and all was focused towards the glitter and glamour of
them only. However, there also exists a world of small people, which
always remains plunged in the darkness of neglects, which cherishes a
tradition survived by the people who keep struggling for preserving their
values, even amid tremendous odds. But, the attention of people rarely
wanders towards that world.

When we read the creations of litterateurs like Premchand, we come to
know about the ways, how people used to adorn their lives apart from
living it. And therefore, if we want to realize our strength, if we want
to identify ourselves, we need to take a glance on the life of these
small people unnoticeable in darkness. This is the mindset of some people
that great works can be accomplished in only amid facilities, systems and
in conducive atmosphere. The section having this perception is too large.
And, I ever say to them that if you are feeling insomnia, then even after
the booking of a luxurious room in a five star hotel with your choice of
temperature, mattress and music, there is no guarantee that you enjoy a
sound sleep.

It is not likely that opportunities, facilities and systems always
provide the solution. If you have a spark and a passion within you to do
something in the life, you can overcome all the difficulties and
challenges. If we look at those people who got achievements in life, most
of them have devoted inexhaustible energy in struggling against
adversities. Despite that they have bestowed upon us too much.

If you cast a glance over the sequence of any historical saga happened in
the world, you will come to know that it is the small peoples, who are
considered inferior by society, have made a significant contribution.
Even if we study the whole Ramayana, look into the narratives of Sita,
Rama and Lakshman, we can't erase the memories of that small squirrel,
which devoted her all–out efforts for the construction of Ram Setu (Ram's
bridge) and her task gained the kudos even from Rama. We might forget the
entire story of Ramayana, but can't forget the tribal woman Shabri, who
fed sweet berries to Rama. We may remember many forms of Shri Krishna,
but we cannot forget the Sudama and the other cowherds' friends of
Krishna. We know that Chhatrapati Shivaji gained victory over a vast
area, but how can we forget those small Maratha warriors, who scarified
their lives to conquer the fort of Sinhgad. If we recall the sacrificial
tradition of Sikh Gurus, then who were the Panj Pyare (the five beloved
ones)? They were the simple people, who brought forward a great
tradition. It is the common people, who shape the history and bring a
change in the perception of society.

It has been the misfortune of our country that even after independence,
our attention is focused towards ruling systems and ruling politicians.
Sometimes, it seems that these are being given too much undue importance.
A teacher who throughout of his life might have inspired hundreds of
youngsters to become doctors, engineers and writers, has no road or
'chowk' named after him or her. On the other hand, if someone is elected
as corporater, just in a few days the roads, Chowk are named after him.
Sometimes, his statue is also put up there.

The small peoples, who dedicate their lives for the sake of the society,
are far away from this political punctilio and they are crores in
numbers. Let us look at whole the agricultural world. The Agriculture
sector has gained more strength from the continuous experiments of common
farmers in their difficult circumstances of the villages in comparison to
scientists conducting experiments in laboratories. But, unfortunately
these small farmers don't catch our attention at all. By identifying and
connecting the strength of such people, the power of the society can be
enhanced and by connecting the power of societies, the power of country
can be enhanced manifold.

And therefore, who has accomplished something or other, who has shown us
living even amid unfavourable circumstances and have inspired others by
setting the examples of their own lives, who are like a single lamp
lighting up thousands lamps, it is my fortune that I have a chance to see
these luminaries. There are such uncountable people in each corner of the
India. But, question arises how can we recognize the strength of these
all?

The fundamental value of India is 'Tena Tyaktena Bhunjitha' (Enjoy, what
is given by Him, with renunciation). Renunciation for others is the
integral part of our fundamental thinking. And the people like this are
created from these values, who inspire so many other people and they have
their own saga and characteristics. I am hopeful that after this program,
many people would be keen and receptive to pay their attention towards
these small people. They would also feel enthusiasm watching their lives.

However, the people leading such kind of life look extremely satisfied,
because whatever they do, just do for 'Swantah Sukhaya' (Happiness for
oneself). Someone asked great poet Tulsi Das, 'Why are you composing this
epic?' His straight reply was 'Brother! I'm doing this because I feel
immense pleasure while doing this. It is not my tension that world will
accept it or not. I do it just for my self–happiness and satisfaction.'

These are the people, who, in pursuance of their own pleasure and
satisfaction, can't choke their emotion to accomplish that work. By
carrying out that unremitting toil, they purge their emotional tensions
and that is how they reach this height of success. How to bring into
light these great values? How to strive for these outstanding values? How
to inspire common people for assimilating these values? A strength
emerges from these kinds of events. I, once again, salute and
congratulate these champions. The example set by them would prove source
of inspiration for listeners and readers. I am immensely thankful to
Times Now owing to which I had the chance to get a vision of these
shakers and movers and understand their dreams as well as lives.

Thank you very much.

"i62181","t20141109128058","Respected noble men, all the senior gentlemen present on the stage and the ones who have decided to 
do something and are doing as per the beliefs which are inspired by Eknath ji, I welcome all such 
respected gentlemen here. 

This is a matter of great honour to pay respect, to get a chance to express devoutnessin the 
inauguration ceremony of centenary festival of such a gentleman, who has always been a source of 
inspirationsince our childhood, with whom we had a chance to work at very young age, every time 
whose thoughts and beliefs teaches us something new, who had spent his life's most important phase 
under his guidance, if the person gets a chance like this, you can imagine how great the matter 
ofpride would be. There would be many people here who got naturally connected to Eknath ji. I also 
had a close contact with Eknath ji and I found that he was such a great protagonist of perfection, that 
sometimes people who used to work with him had to face some difficulties to reach the desired level. 

When it was being decided how the statues of Swami Vivekanandaon Vivekananda Rock Memorial 
should look like, I had also heard those discussions. In which direction should the eyes of 
Vivekanandajigaze, what should the gaze convey, he used to discuss about these things in intricate 
details with those craftsmen and sculptors. When the rock memorial is being made, the sea winds 
have their own behaviour. Those rocks should be selected which can withstand sea winds, containing 
salt and arid air till centuries, how to select those rocks so that there should be no scratches on them 
from the sea winds. After making it, they felt, how they can use new technologies, how to use new 
chemicals that can keep it protected after an application in few years. Though, this was not his 
subject also. He was neither a scientist nor an architect, but he had a quality that whatever he does, 
it should be permanent, it should be in accordance with the future, and it should be easy and 
productive. He always used to make plans on such points. And this thought in his mind, that 
partnership should be involved in the work undertaken by any individual, maybe this was India's first 
initiative which involved such a comprehensive and supportiveplanning for partnership. 

If any person above 40 years of age will be asked, he will say, “Yes”, he also gave a rupee for 
construction of Vivekananda Rock Memorial. 

Whenever people above 40 years of age in this country would see Swami Vivekananda's Rock 
Memorial, they would feel and see themselves in it, they would feel that they have also contributed 
toit. 

We need to create such a feeling in every corner of India that even though the rock memorial is 
located at the sea shores of Kanyakumari, I feel connected and I have a contribution in this work, no 
matter, I am from north–east or western India or I am from north India or from any corner of world. If 
the emotional attachment with culture could have involved only money, then donations from 40–50 
people were enough. 

Look at their other skill. During that period of time in this country, there was a political situation in 
which there was no consent, no appreciation of the work done in a state. In this way, the political 
establishment at that time was seen as political opposition. In such kind of environment, there was 
not a single Indian Chief Minister, Governor, Central minister, on whose door Eknath ji did not 
knock. He went to each of them, made the plan for rock memorial and maybe there wasanysuch 
statewho did not made the contribution through its government. This task was not simple, but with 
the strong principles, people affected by any kind of political thoughts or beliefs could be united for 
any good deed, that is why Eknathji'sprimarily focused on unity in every task. To connect the things 
together. Heused to link the past with future. He also used to interlink opposite ideologies. In 1975, 
when emergency was imposed,members of Sangh family who were the believers of democracy were in 
jail but Eknath ji at that time was a good medium to have discussion with people who were in power 
due to his personality. This matter was not disclosed then. 

The way Vinoba Bhave at that time of emergency, went to the place which was made for Smt. Indira 
Gandhi, he had a few words with Vinoba Bhave which turned to be fruitful. But Eknath ji Ranade 
used to think how to get out of these kinds of situations, with whom to discuss and all. The people in 
power had full faith on Eknath ji that they could have discussion with him. An important role,  because I was with him during those days and I have seen his work closely. Because everyone 
thought Eknath ji would be arrested and put behind the bars. But because of his personality, he used 
to search the solutions for problems so that the situation does not turn in to worst. Eknath ji Ranade 
played a significant role in this. But he kept himself away from publicity and fame, he was so 
engrossed in the work that such works were not highlighted from his end. 

Identification of a man and his research used to be his speciality. Once, he said, “I am coming by 
some train, you come to the railway station and after taking bath anywhere near the station, you 
come along with me to Mount Abu.” I didn't know the work and the nature of work, and then, I came 
to know that he had no reservation. So, I guess, there used to be a third class in the train at that 
time. I thought he would have come in that class. He was looking very tired. I told him to take some 
rest. He said, “No, if you want to reach Mount Abu, then come with me.” We took bath somewhere 
near the station and commenced the journey. I asked him in between the journey that you 
commenced the journey all of a sudden. He wanted to meet the swami ji from Ramakrishna Mission 
who had separated himself from Ramakrishna Mission and used to reside in Mount Abu for 
meditation, he used to live his life in isolation. We went and saw him and greeted him with our 
pranaam (greetings)with great devotion. I went as a Swayamsevak, I had no role, I got the chance to 
observe things. Eknath ji was requesting him that it is fine that you have separated yourself from the 
system of Ramakrishna Mission, and working separately, but this is a great work, join hands with the 
system of Vivekananda Stone Memorial so thatyour meditation will impart some knowledge to the 
youth, so you work for it. This means, putting so much efforts to include this man in the work who is 
sitting in Mount Abu after waiting for three days and be seated in every half an hour or 45 minutes 
again for the discussion, then again sitting after every two hours and start discussing with open 
heart. He was pursuing him completely. I was observing that for one task, Eknath jiis known for his 
“One life one mission” statement and he did exactly the same. How he got the people for victory of 
that task. And when he imagined including the power of youth of this country who respect and 
admire Swami Vivekananda, he made it happen. We liked Swami Vivekananda, but it was not enough 
to make things work. The picture of Mother India that he has visualised, he has imagined, we need to 
put our efforts in the formation and implementation of that picture, and he used to consistently try to 
achieve it. He used to do the work with his whole dedication in order to spread awareness among the 
youth of this country. 

The time when youths were being interviewed for membership, I also got the chance to sit on the 
interview panel. Those who passed the first round, were then interviewed by Eknath Ji himself and 
whosoever met Eknath jigot so inspired by him that he/she refused to go back home. They pleaded in 
front of him to select them and also promised him that if asked by him, they would do anything. I 
think this is a great achievement in itself. Swami VivekanandajiformedRamakrishna Mission with the 
same ideals as Vivekananda Centre. At times two institutions with similar ideology start moving 
parallel instead of working together. Eknath ji was totally dedicated towards his goal and he never 
compromised with the means to attain the goals. 

He was a perfectionist and everyone has observed it closely. Such was his simplicity that despite 
making such a big memorial that is worth millions, he chose to stay in a small cottage with a tin roof. 
He could have easily got a nice house or rather a small bungalow made for himself and no one would 
have objected but he chose to stay in that small cottage. He stayed there till his last breath. People 
who knew him know this. He did nothing for himself and amongst RSS members, no one could match 
his perfectionist nature. He would not even compromise on the type of paper to be used. 

Once, he had come to attend an RSS camp in Gujarat and we had made arrangements for him to stay 
with a family. The camp was for three days and I did not get a chance to meet him for the first two 
days and when I met him on the third day, I found him disturbed with the staying arrangements 
because the room that he was staying in, had thetube light tilted in one direction. He didn't relax and 
sit in that home with his family, till the time, he did not fix the tube light. 

I remember one incident, our respected Guruji had passed away. The time of death was 9:05 pm. 
Media had to be informed about it later. The time has changed now. Nowadays, technology is so 
advanced that information could be conveyed even at 11 pm in the night. At that time, it happened at 
9 pm, so it was important to pass the information as soon as possible. We had to make a draft for 
informing media of Guruji's demise and the plan for his last rites. Eknath Ji was present at that time 
when he passed away. He was assigned the task of preparing draft. Now, you can imagine his 
devotion towards Guruji, his dedication, the limitedness of time and it had to be informed to media. 
He sat down to prepare the draft. The limitednessof time. There were no computers at that time. Even 
typing didn't help. The alphabets used to be very small. His handwriting was excellent. He used to 
write 3 or 4 lines and then throw the sheets. He used to write 7–8 lines and then didn't like them due 
to lack of perfection. On the other side, everyone was worried, media was waiting. Do it soon. 
Anyways, the perfectionism was so much in his nature that he was not able to do this and I 
remember that Baba Ji Satya took that awayfrom him and said, whatever you have done is right, I am 
sending this now and then he sent it. It was his specialty to ensure that words will be written orderly. 
He has the speciality to ensure perfection in everything. 

His diary, I don't remember where his diary has been kept, how it has been kept. He followed a 
different approach while writing his diary. He didn't write the diary in a way, we write. He had a 
different approach. He would write about the people he used to meet, excerpts of his conversation 
with the people he met and jot down nuggets of wisdom in his diary. He used to cut down those 
thoughts from his diary which don't work in the life 

He was so hard working that he could not tolerate being sick. He would become restless and 
disturbed, if he fell sick and the others around him would also get disturbed. Sometimes, it seems like 
he would become childish and everyone around him would get disturbed too. I have been so close to 
him that today I am reliving the time spent with him by sharing these memories from my heart. 

He had a strong belief in youth. Just as VivekanandaJi had once said that he could do anything if he 
gets 1000 youngsters. He always endeavoured to give the nation VivekanandaJi like youth. 
Vivekananda Centre has silently played a major role in bringing change in the lives of the people of 
North East. We can do a lot for the nation in spite of the hurdles and difficulties that comes in 
between. We can live for the nation. Educated youth who have been born and brought up in well–
settled families of North East have dedicated their lives to the jungles under Eknathji's mentorship. 
This is not a small thing and sometimes after become a saint,it used to be a kind of legacy in India 
that once, you become saint and possess those clothes, the society automatically puts you up on a 
pedestal. Respecting you, caring about your happiness and wellness is in the nature of this society. 
Living a saint's life in the common man's attire is a very difficult task. To overcome the indifference of 
the society and to keep yourself motivated to keep working towards is a difficult feat which he and 
these youths under his mentorship achieved. Society has this feeling and respect for the saints but 
not for the people who wear pants even if they live their life like saints from inside, they live the life 
that is expected from the saints. Sometimes, this is a difficult moment and this becomes difficult to 
say, “You have come, please sit”. In that state, it becomes very difficult to accept this life and live it. 

A political leader carries the legacy of leadership and a saint carries the legacy of culture and 
tradition but to set out on a path without any legacy just because Eknath ji said it or it was an 
inspiration from Vivekanandaji, is something commendable. I believe that it was an extraordinary 
work done by him and several hundreds of youth followed him. 

Secondly, he institutionalised this idea. Even today, many young people join Vivekananda Centre, 
they renounce their careers and families to join the centre and dedicate their lives to it. On the whole 
with 'one life one mission', there is no other way except social service. The welfare of mother India the 
pledge taken by him to realize the dream of Swami Vivekananda has been the speciality of his life 
and hence, I believe that Ranade centenary year is the year of awakening the minds of the youth of 
the country and an opportunity to make young India a great country. Our India is young and it 
should be made grand and heavenly. We are not amongst those who look for only greatness, we are 
amongst those who wants divinity as well because the world is expecting divine realization from India 
and the poorest of the poor person of India expects the greatness for India. We have to move ahead in 
the direction of building India by the amalgamation of these two. I believe that for the completion of 
this task the birth centenary of Eknath ji gives us inspiration. 

Sometimes, a common man is faced with a dilemma in his life, the purpose of life of most of the 
people is success, but the Vivekananda Centre does not inspire us to walk only the path of success 
and from here the change begins. You tell anyone or listen to anyone in the world, everyone says – 'Be 
successful'! Everyone conveys the same message. But the message of Eknath ji did not used to stop 
at 'Be successful'. His appeal was to be worthwhile. Success is a station in order to be worthwhile 
which takes us to the last station of being worthwhile, but success cannot be the last station of life. 
Today's era that has been benchmarked by success, it requires a lot of worthwhile efforts to take it in 
the direction of being worthwhile. 

When I tell someone the difference between success and worth, it becomes very difficult to explain 
since the world has changed so much today. But if anyone will pay attention to know what work did 
Bill Gates used to do? He made his mark in the world through Microsoft and earned millions and 
billions of rupees. He achieved great heights of success but then he realized that I became successful 
but have not become worthwhile yet. And then what he did? He donated his entire money, and after 
donating, he went to the poor countries and started raising awareness about toilets, he told them to 
make toilets. He is realizing the worth of life. How to take success to the new heights of worthiness? 
How to make life not only successful but also worthwhile? This direction of worthwhile life… if we 
succeed in conveying the message on the centenary year of Eknath ji then this becomes an 
opportunity/occasion to give a new way of thinking, new direction, revived zest and zeal, new 
inspiration, new pledge, and new aim to the young generation of our country and we must avail this 
opportunity. 

Eknath Ji would never give up. He would look at every difficulty as an opportunity to turn things 
around. To turn every difficulty into an opportunity! When the foundation for the memorial was being 
laid there were a lot of difficulties that he had to face. Government was not in favour. There were  many people to claim on it. There was a danger in front of fishermen as they were concerned about 
their livelihood, there were many kinds of issues, but he resolved all these issues through mutual 
understanding. There was a time when people would only visit religious shrines like Badrinath and 
Kedarnath but today people of our country want to visit this memorial. This work was accomplished 
by this great man in this generation itself. Eknath ji did not make a lifeless memorial but a system 
full of life and consciousness. He set up a system full of life and consciousness, which is bringing 
incessant consciousness in the society. He set up a tradition where generation after generation youth 
dedicate themselves and their lives for the welfare of the nation. 

I feel I was fortunate to have been mentored by such a great personality. It is a matter of great 
privilege. He would bless me and pamper me sometimes. I used to observe that we would take a nap 
in afternoon but he would not. He used to tell me that we would go for a walk after having lunch. So, 
he started asking me to accompany him on afternoon walks and gradually I got out of the habit of 
sleeping in afternoon. So, these small things such as helping in the overall growth of partner, how to 
help in the overall growth of partner, putting conscious efforts in the achievement of same, this has 
been the unique speciality of his life. I bow my head to his life, his work and his dreams. I believe this 
effort will give the inspiration to the young generation of our nation to strive for meaningful life. I am 
sure that it will open the way to proceed towards worthiness from success, and the dream of adding 
worth to the ordinary human life will come true. There will be successful efforts in this direction. 

I would again like to salute the members of Vivekananda Centre whole heartedly for their great efforts 
and I am sure that their efforts and message will bring progress in people's lives. Thanks a lot!

"i66520","t20160207773753","Honourable Governor of Andhra Pradesh and Chief Ministers

My Cabinet colleagues;

Delegates of Foreign Navies;

Brave and proud men and women of the Indian Navy; and

The resolute people of this great city– Visakhapatnam.



I am privileged to visit Visakhapatnam. The city has a special place in
the heart of all Indians.

My last visit to Vishakhapatnam was in October of 2014.

At that time, Cyclone Hudhud had left the city shattered in pieces.

But, the people of Vishakhapatnam smiled in the face of adversity.

It is a tribute to the city that within 14 months, you have risen against
all odds to welcome the Navies from across the continents in this
International Fleet Review.

A little over a year ago, we saw the full fury of the ocean. Today,
thanks to the spirit of the people of Visakhapatnam, we are discussing
how the oceans can be a source of economic prosperity for all of us.

For its courage and resolve, we all salute the city of Visakhapatnam.

My profuse thanks to the men and women of the Indian Navy for their
tireless dedication for making this Fleet Review a truly historic success.

My sincere gratitude also to Chief Minister Chandrababu Naiduji for his
strong support for this international event.

For me personally, witnessing the harmony among the best of International
Navies here has been a rewarding experience.

Just over three months earlier in October, we welcomed in Delhi, for the
first time ever, all the 54 African nations, including over 40 Heads of
State for the 3rd India–Africa Summit.

A few weeks earlier in August 2015, India had hosted in Jaipur 14 Heads
of the State for the Second Forum for India–Pacific Island Cooperation.

Just day before yesterday, we welcomed all the SAARC countries for the
12th South Asian Games in Guwahati.

And today it is our pleasure to welcome 50 foreign Navies from every
corner of the globe at India's second International Fleet review– the
first one on India's East Coast.

Your participation is a message of cooperation and friendship that we
deeply cherish.

On behalf of my countrymen, I thank you all for accepting our invitation
and joining in this event with such spirit.

To build on the gains from today's gathering, India would host the first
ever Global Maritime Summit in April this year.

Its priority would be to scale up and strengthen the vibrant trade /
investment / technology and commercial linkages between India and other
maritime nations.

Friends,

The oceans and world's waterways are global commons. Vasudhaiva
Kutumbakam– the concept of whole world as a family – is perhaps most
vividly witnessed on the oceans of the planet, that connect us all.

The last time India hosted the International Fleet Review was in the year
2001, in the city of Mumbai.

The world of 2016 is vastly different.

Its politics is turbulent, and its challenges complex.

At the same time, the oceans are the lifelines of global prosperity. They
present us with great economic opportunities to build our nations.

Over 90percent of global merchandise trade is carried on the oceans.

Over the last 15 years, its value has grown from about 6 trillion dollars
to about 20 trillion dollars.

Oceans are critical for the global energy security as over 60percent of
world's oil production moves through sea routes.

Our ability to reap economic benefits from the oceans rests on our
capacity to respond to the challenges in the maritime domain.

The threat of sea borne terror, of which India has been a direct victim,
continues to endanger the regional and global peace and stability.

Piracy too remains a strong challenge.

The threat of natural disasters like tsunamis and cyclones is ever
present.

Manmade problems such as oil spills, climate change continue to risk the
stability of the maritime domain.

A peaceful and stable maritime environment is, therefore, critical for
the regional and global security. It is also a must to harvest the riches
of the oceanic ecosystems.

Given the scale and complexity of modern day challenges, the
international maritime stability cannot be the preserve of a single
nation.

It has to be a shared goal and responsibility of all the seafaring
countries.

To this end, the Navies and maritime agencies of the world need to work
together, and engineer virtuous cycles of cooperation.

But, where necessary, they also need to act to secure the international
sea lanes of communication.

I believe that if oceans were to propel our economies, then we must:

Use seas to build peace, friendship and trust, and curb conflict;

 respect and ensure freedom of navigation; and

 cooperate, not compete in responding to the challenges in the seas.

The large presence of foreign Navies at this Fleet Review is a
confirmation of our shared urge to walk the pathways of peace and
cooperation to keep the maritime domain safe and secure.

Friends,

India is, and has always been, a maritime nation.

India's ancient Sanskrit texts also refer to the oceans as the storehouse
of Chaturdashanam Ratnanam, the 14 gems.

Surrounded by sea from three sides, India has a long coastline of over
7500 kilometres.

We have been blessed with a rich maritime heritage ever since . Lothal in
Gujarat became one of the earliest sea ports of the world.

India's central location in the Indian Ocean has connected us with
other cultures, shaped our maritime trade routes, influenced India's
strategic thought, and defined our maritime character.

Since the days of the Indus Valley Civilization, India has maintained an
extensive network of maritime links, including with Africa, Western Asia,
the Mediterranean region, the West, South East Asia and the Far East.

We are delighted that the Navies from all these regions have joined in
this Fleet Review.

The Photo Essay book on the 'Maritime Heritage of India', that I have
just released, showcases this glorious maritime tradition.

Friends,

In moderntimes too, the oceans, especially the Indian Ocean, occupy a
vital place in India's national security and economic prosperity. The
waters of the Indian Ocean touch the shores of over 40 countries.

About half of world's container traffic; and close to one–third of
world's cargo traffic passes through this region.

90percent of our trade by volume and 90percent of our oil imports are carried on the
seas.

India's 1200 island territories, and our huge Exclusive Economic Zone
of 2. 4 million square kilometers makes clear the economic significance of
the Indian Ocean.

For us, it also serves as a strategic bridge with the nations in our
immediate and extended maritime neighbourhood.

In March last year, in Mauritius,I had spelt out our vision for the
Indian Ocean.

The Indian Ocean Region is one of my foremost policy priorities. Our
approach is evident in our vision of “Sagar”, which means “Ocean”
and stands for – Security And Growth for All in the Region.

We would continue to actively pursue and promote our geo–political,
strategic and economic interests on the seas, in particular the Indian
Ocean.

To this end, India's modern and multi–dimensional Navy leads from the
front. It is a force for peace and good.

A network of growing political and economic maritime partnerships, and
strengthening of regional frameworksalso helps us pursue our goals.

Friends,

India's quest for economic prosperity through oceans is a part of our
larger efforts to transform India.

We are not just a bright spot in the global economy. Regionally and
internationally, we are a pillar of stability and an important growth
centre.

India's rise is in harmony with the goal of maintaining the regional and
global peace and security.

Within the country, there is great optimism, enthusiasm and a “can
do” mindset.

This optimism comes from the energy and enterprise of our confident youth.

It also comes from our bold and sustained measures to transform our
country, improve our laws, processes and institutions.

We are launching new initiatives and creating opportunities to empower
people, and give them a sense of ownership in nation's progress.

“Make in India”, which has re–ignited our manufacturing sector is one
such initiative.

Defence manufacturing and ship building are among its focus areas.

In a week from now, on 13 February, we would hold 7 days of global
engagement under ""Make in India"" in Mumbai.

During this time, the best in the global industry would link up with the
innovation, design and manufacturing opportunities of India– the world's
fastest growing economy.

We want to invite the world to Make in India, Make for India, and Make
for the World.

We take pride in the fact that of all the Indian Naval ships
participating in this Fleet Review, at least 37 are “Made in India”
– a number that will surely rise in the coming years.

Our “Skill India” program is building institutions that train,
support, encourage and guide our 800 million youth on the path of
entrepreneurship.

Our skilled youth are ready to respond to the national and global
manpower demands of the 21st century.

An important part of India's transformation is my vision of “Blue
Economy” in its widest sense.

The Blue Chakra – or the wheel – in our National Flag, represents the
potential of the Blue Economy.

An essential part of this pursuit is the development of India's coastal
and island territories: but, not just for tourism.

We want to build new pillars of economic activity in the coastal areas
and in linked hinterlands through sustainable tapping of oceanic
resources.

Strengthening our marine research, development of eco–friendly, marine
industrial and technology base, and fisheries are other elements of our
goal.

In this endeavour, I see youth in the coastal areas as our true assets.
They have a natural and deep understanding of the Oceans.

They could lead the way in the development of blue economy in India.

In partnership with all the coastal states of India, I want to shape a
special program of skilling India's youth in the coastal areas of the
country.

Friends,

In the end, let me once again congratulate the Indian Navy for the
flawless conduct of this grand event.

For the homeward journey of all our Naval friends from across the world,
may you always have fair winds, following seas, and many a fathom below
your keel.

Thank You.

Jai Hind!

The Celebration

In this festival of kites, turning my face up to the sun In my hands, I thread the kite’s string
My feet planted on this earth, firmly.
And in the sky, astride my kite
I imagine a bird’s-eye view of this jubilee The sky is full of colour, a panoply.
My kite dances amongst the others, a festival of paper Holi The treetops sing as the wind whistles,
No branches catch my kite, as it dances and twirls.
This kite is my own teacher, my Gayatri mantra To all seekers it grants knowledge.
For once it escapes, its tether cut,
Everyone likes to chase it
No matter wealthy, brilliant or poor,
A release from all bonds, old and new, past and future.
This kite has the grace of the sky, and the wind’s sense. The kite that soared, even once, so high
Has the memory of experience, of that essence.
My journey towards the sun too Is a kite’s life, limited by a string.
O Lord Shiva, master of the universe The kite’s string is in my hands.
As my string is in yours.
For the cause of every kite, the wind blows
For the cause of every being, Lord Shiva turns. The kite dreams far higher than human ambition
Casting off its string, it flies into Lord Shiva’s lap,
While we remain on this earth, And spend our days untangling each other’s knots.","pms","modi","2014","201411","20141101","pmo","firstterm","nda2","selfpolitics","book","other","other","other","india","ncr","newdelhi","otherstate","hindiother","book","xxxxx","nmo2014","123","689155","notrans","sneha","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","other","modi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","nmo_boo","na","yes","others","m","bjp","nmo_se","nmo_nda2","bjp_nmo","bjp_se","bjp_nda2","m_nmo","m_se","m_nda2","pms2014","pms_nmo","pms_se","pms_nda2","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_boo","nmo_nat_boo","nmo_p1_boo","nmo_da_se","nmo_nat_se","nmo_p1_se","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_boo","nmo_nat_boo","nmo_p1_boo","nmo_da_se","nmo_nat_se","nmo_p1_se","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_boo","nmo_nat_boo","nmo_p1_boo","nmo_da_se","nmo_nat_se","nmo_p1_se","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_boo","nmo_nat_boo","nmo_p1_boo","nmo_da_se","nmo_nat_se","nmo_p1_se","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_se","nmo_se","nmo_se","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","nmo","nmo","nmo","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_se","nmo_se","nmo_se","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiother","modi_books","nmo","se","boo","f","bjp_nmo","bjp_boo","bjp_nda2","bjp_se","lib_nmo","lib_boo","lib_nda2","lib_se","lib_bjp","lib2014","lib_bjp_boo","nmo_boo_2014","nmo_se_2014","bjp_boo_2014","bjp_se_2014","other","o201411","nmo_boo_201411","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_se","pms_nmo","pms_se","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_boo","nmo_b","nmo_b","nmo_b","nmo_b","Mb","Mb","Mb","Mb",NA,NA,NA,245

"i77129","t20181029678232","Present here in large numbers business leaders and CEOs from Japan and India,
Senior officials of Keidanren, Jetro, NIKKI, CII, and NASCOM,

Speaking with the business community here after coming to Japan always gives me great pleasure. I still remember that for the last ten years I have been having detailed conversations with the entrepreneurs here. I understood your vision and learned many new things from you. In the last decade your intimacy towards India has been growing steadily over time.

Efforts of government of India at every level are such so as to change the business environment in the country in such a way that at every step you have a feeling of ease of doing business and ease of living.

Friends,

A few years ago I talked about making a mini Japan in India. It is a great pleasure for me that today you are working in India at a much larger level.

For many decades, there were about 1150 Japanese companies in India, however between the years 2014 to 2017, more than 200 new companies of Japan have started operating in India. These numbers are increasing day by day. You all deserve congratulations for this.

Today Japanese companies in India are working in areas from car manufacturing to communications and from infrastructure to services. This pleasant journey between India and Japan becomes even more pleasurable and result-oriented, for this also my congratulations to all of you.

Friends,

The spirit of co-existence of India and Japan is based on trust and our shared heritage, it is based on our intimacy. The foundation of close relationships between the two countries is this spirit and ritual.

This is the reason that during my first visit as a Prime Minister in 2014, we had decided that both countries will take this relationship to a new height by upgrading it to the level of Special Strategic and Global Partnership. Since then, the Hon'ble Prime Minister of Japan, Abe and I have been continuously meeting each-other. Prime Minister Mr. Abe and we together have overcome many business related obstacles between the two countries.

Friends,

Over last few years Japanese government has assisted in many of our ambitious infrastructure projects. Our Western Dedicated Freight Corridor is now about to be completed. After one year it will reach the state of being fully operational. Connected with it our project of Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor is going on well with the cooperation of Japanese government and Japanese companies.

During last visit of Hon'ble Abe San to India, we decided to work together on High Speed Rail Project. India's first High Speed Rail project has started between Mumbai-Ahmedabad and work on this project is going on at a great pace.

Friends,

It has been almost four and half years since the formation of my government in India. During this period, issue related to business which have been on top of my priority list is - Ease of Doing Business. Its result is now in front of the world. In 2014, when I took over the reins of the government, India's position in World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking was 142th. Now we are on hundredth rank and are still working on a very extensive scale to improve the rankings. We are taking one step after the other at the level of the federal government, at the level of State Government and at local government level. This will produce even better results in the coming years.

Such a big improvement has been made possible with quick and decisive actions, and changing archaic laws.

Here I would like to tell you another important thing. Government of India has started ranking of its 36 States and Union Territories to further promote Ease of Doing business.

There has been a major benefit because of this, that now there is healthy competition between the states, which has started to show very pleasant results.

Friends,

Capital investment is the need of our country. That is the reason we are taking sincere steps in the area of Ease of Doing Business. When capital investment will be created, new employment opportunities will be created for the unemployed, there will be improvement in the country's infrastructure, and value addition in agriculture, mineral, sea resources and all other natural resources of the country.

Our efforts to provide our citizens with the ease of living is an extension of the Ease of Doing Business.

Therefore, we have worked in the area of Ease of Doing Business using a super campaign. We achieved a lot of other things due to these super efforts:

We have scaled up 21 places in the Global Innovation Index rankings of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

In World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, we have climbed 31 places in 2 years.

India is firmly named in 10 FDI destinations listed by UNCTAD.

In the last few years we have done quite a lot of reforms in the field of FDI. Today, we have become the most open economy in terms of FDI. More than 90 percent of permissions are now given on Automatic Route.

The result is that our FDI has increased from $ 36 billion in the last 3 years to $ 60 billion.

Today we are the fastest growing major economy of the world.

Now we are an economy of $ 2. 59 trillion. We are world’s sixth largest economy and soon to be the fifth largest economy.

At the domestic level, the commitment with which we have made reforms has resulted in changes in Indian economy such as:

Its shifting from being an informal Economy to a formal economy.

Transactions are now conducted online rather than on paper, which has led to increased stability and transparency.

Transportation has become easy due to GST being implemented across the country and the Logistics sector has become stronger.

Over the time we have been reducing corporate tax. There is a special focus so that MSME i. e. small industries derive maximum benefit out of it.

Demand of business class for Stability and Transparency in policies has now become the identity of the Government of India.

Friends,

During my first visit to Japan as the Prime Minister, I talked about setting up an organization named Japan Plus. I am very happy to say that JETRO and you all have used that system.

On this occasion, I would like to share another information. Japan Plus works with our Invest India. Just a few days back United Nations has rewarded Invest India with a global honor for its marvelous work.

Friends,

Fast growing economy of India, its rapidly growing middle class, rapidly growing urban population and our Young Demography provides a very wide scope to Japanese companies working here.

Let me give some examples-

In the last four years under special programs like Make in India we have progressed towards making India a Global Hub in the field of Manufacturing and Research.

There is a lot of potential especially for Japanese MSME companies to work in India. Here I would like to say that while every major Japanese company coming to India is welcome but through MSME also Japanese business leaders can take their business to new heights. The results for MSMEs are visible in less time.

One of the benefits of doing business in India is also the Low cost manufacturing. Behind it, is the Competitive Labor Cost which is a huge force in India.

Similarly our IT industry is also a big force. I have come here earlier and said it that if our software meets with your hardware, then I believe that we can create miracles in the world.

Not only this, India is rapidly moving towards industry 4. 0 through new inventions in the field of technology like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, 3D Printing, and Robotics etc.

Similarly, Electric Mobility is an area in which cooperation between India and Japan is going to prove to be extremely profitable for both countries.

Friends,

Apart from this, we are doing unprecedented work in India on Infrastructure too. Now our emphasis is on Next Generation Infrastructure. We intend that we create such a Competitive Economy whose foundations are Skill, Speed ​​and Scale. To realize this idea, we are constantly trying to improve the investment climate.

Today, from this forum, I invite all of you for the vast business opportunities that are being created in India. I would like to give you some more examples of this immense opportunity:

Our Sagarmala program through which we want to connect the coastal regions to the regional areas of the country is a great opportunity for you.

A lot of new opportunities are also being created due to the Smart City program. We also want to introduce metro rail in 50 of our cities.

Similarly our rail and road extension and modernization program is also very huge. We still have to build many high speed corridors.

With the modernization of the existing ports and airports, establishment of new ports and airports is also on our agenda.

Inland Water Transport and Green Energy is our new commitment and that too is a great opportunity for you.

Our steel consumption is currently very low. Iron is also abundant. I want to produce high grade steel in India.

Friends,

Both India and Japan are strong supporters of democratic values ​​and freedoms.

Also, there are many similarities in our approach and outlook to policies for development.

Apart from infrastructure and capacity building, there is strong potential for cooperation between Japan and India in third countries in health and agriculture sectors.

Therefore, whether it is Indo-Pacific or South Asia or Africa, India and Japan will strengthen their participation in the development of third countries on the basis of priorities of our partner countries.

With the entry of Japan into the International Solar Alliance, new partnership doors are open between our two countries on the topics of solar energy and climate change in third countries.

I am happy that in today’s meeting of the India Japan Business Leaders Forum many members of the forum presented a number of good ideas for enhancing the cooperation between Indian and Japanese businessmen in these areas in Africa.

Friends,

I've always been talking about Strong India - Strong Japan.

On this occasion I express our gratitude to Japan's entrepreneurial class for having special faith in India.

I would also like to invite all of you to increase the pace of investment in India.

I assure you that you will be helped in every possible way to further strengthen trade relations between Japan and India.

Once again I am very thankful to all of you for joining this event.

Thank you.","pms","modi","2018","201810","20181029","pmo","firstterm","nda2","foreignpolicy","speech","other","other","other","abroad","japan","tokyo","otherstate","hindiother","englishtranslationofpmsaddressatmakeinindiaindiajapanpartnershipinafricadigitalpartnershipseminarintokyo","httpwwwpibnicinpressrelesedetailaspxprid1551058","nmo2018","5206","5206","notrans","collective","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","modi","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","others","pms","others","others","others","na","yes","others","others","others","others","others","na","na","ns","na","na","na","nmo_spe","na","yes","others","m","bjp","nmo_fo","nmo_nda2","bjp_spe","bjp_fo","bjp_nda2","m_spe","m_fo","m_nda2","pms2018","pms_spe","pms_fo","pms_nda2","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_fo","nmo_nat_fo","nmo_p1_fo","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_fo","nmo_nat_fo","nmo_p1_fo","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_fo","nmo_nat_fo","nmo_p1_fo","nmo_da","nmo_nat","nmo_p1","nmo_da_spe","nmo_nat_spe","nmo_p1_spe","nmo_da_fo","nmo_nat_fo","nmo_p1_fo","modi_spe","modi_spe","modi_spe","modi_fo","modi_fo","modi_fo","modi_nda2","modi_nda2","modi_nda2","nmo","nmo","nmo","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_fo","nmo_fo","nmo_fo","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","nmo_nda2","mint","clean","lib","hindiother","pms","nmo","fo","spe","f","bjp_nmo","bjp_spe","bjp_nda2","bjp_fo","lib_nmo","lib_spe","lib_nda2","lib_fo","lib_bjp","lib2018","lib_bjp_spe","nmo_spe_2018","nmo_fo_2018","bjp_spe_2018","bjp_fo_2018","other","o201810","nmo_spe_201810","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_fo","pms_spe","pms_fo","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_spe","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","nmo_s","Ms","Ms","Ms","Ms",NA,NA,NA,1793
